Description: When assigned "R for Data Science" (Wickham, Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, 
  and Grolemund (2023, ISBN: 1492097402)), students should read the book and
  type in all the associated R commands themselves. Sadly, that never happens.
  These tutorials allow students to demonstrate (and their instructors
  to be sure) that all work has been completed. See Kane (2023)
