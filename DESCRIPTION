Description: When assigned "R for Data Science" (Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, 
  and Grolemund (2023, ISBN: 1492097402)), students should read the book and
  type in all the associated R commands themselves. Sadly, that never happens.
  These tutorials allow students to demonstrate (and their instructors
  to be sure) that all work has been completed. See Kane (2023)

  the 'tutorial.helpers' package for a background discussion.
