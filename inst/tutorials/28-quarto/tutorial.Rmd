<!-- Note how newly created Quarto documents do not have a `format: html` YAML line in the header. I think that this is an RStudio feature. It knows that this directory is a website project and that, therefore, it is unnecessary (?) to even mention the format. Note how the default text in new Quarto documents is different as well. -->

<!-- Should we add /_site/ to .gitignore? https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html -->

<!-- It’s important to note that you don’t need to check your _site or _book directory into version control (if you have done this in the past you know it makes for very messy diffs!). Before proceeding you should add the output directory of your project to .gitignore. For example: -->

<!-- .gitignore -->
<!-- /.quarto/ -->
<!-- /_site/ -->

<!-- Perhaps add something about making the graphic easier to view on the web to the end of the tutorial? I keep thinking that there must be a theme which already does this, but maybe this is enough: p + theme_minimal(base_size = 18). Nice theme article: https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/08/themes-to-improve-your-ggplot-figures. 

Also relevant: https://minimaxir.com/2017/08/ggplot2-web/, with specific web commentary. Maybe just `theme_minimal(base_size=9)` and `ggsave("tutorial-0.png", p, width=4, height=3)`?

Could require them, as last exercise, to choose new theme on their own. Perhaps relevant (from ggplot book):

"For raster graphics (i.e. .png, .jpg), the dpi argument controls the resolution of the plot. It defaults to 300, which is appropriate for most printers, but you may want to use 600 for particularly high-resolution output, or 96 for on-screen (e.g., web) display." 


Could also add this discussion and links to an earlier tutorial, perhaps when we first teach ggsave()?

-->

<!-- Central problem with this tutorial, as with other document/project creation exercises, is that it is unclear what approach is best for students. There are three choices: point/click from RStudio, quarto() R package, and quarto from the command line. -->

<!-- The problem with RStudio is that there is no (?) way to create the four new files in a directory which is already created. But we want to start with a directory, because we want to begin, always, with Github, then connect to an R Project. -->

<!-- The problem with quarto()/quarto is that they make certain desirable things, like doing things in the current directory and providing a title, hard. See Github for discussions. Also, we need to deal with which version we will use. Also, I could not get quarto_publish_site(server = "https://quartopub.com") to work. Very annoying! -->-->

<!-- It is tempting to create three website, using one of the three approaches each time, thereby learning . . . a lot . . . But, for now, I will just use Quarto CLI. Given that choice, we don't need to install nor discuss the quarto package. -->

<!-- Need (?) to cover other material in these chapters, not just websites. Perhaps some examples of interactive pages. At the least, need to review the material in the R4DS chapters. -->


## Introduction
### 

This tutorial covers material from [Chapter 28 Quarto](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) and [Chapter 29 Quarto formats](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto-formats.html) in [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, although much of the information from Chapter 28 has already appeared in the "RStudio and Github" tutorial in this package. We will go into much more detail with regard to the creation and organization of [Quarto websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/). We will learn about Quarto commands like `quarto create`, `quarto render`, `quarto preview` and `quarto publish`, all of which are run from the Terminal.

## Set up Quarto
### 

<!-- Until quarto 1.4 is installed by default, should be upcoming with  Chocolate Cosmos release, we need to check and update by hand  if necessary. -->

We need to ensure that a modern version of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is installed.

### Exercise 1

From the Terminal, run `quarto --version``. CP/CR.

```{r set-up-quarto-1-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should be something like:

````
Davids-MBP:r4ds.tutorials dkane$ quarto --version
1.4.549
Davids-MBP:r4ds.tutorials dkane$ 
````

This should be at least version 1.4. Later versions of Quarto are fine. If the version number is lower than 1.4, [install the latest version of Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).  Restart R Studio once you have done so. 

### 

There are actually three ways to do most things associated with document/project creation: 

First, we can use RStudio. This is our preferred approach, since it is the easiest for beginning students. 

Second, we can use an R package like **quarto** directly. RStudio buttons are, generally, connected to R package commands.

Third, we can work with Quarto directly at the Terminal. This is often referred to as working "from the command line." R packages often call Terminal commands behind the scenes.


## Files for a website
### 

Let's make a [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).

### Exercise 1

Create a public Github repo (called "first-website"). Make sure to click the "Add a README file" check box. Copy/paste the url for its Github location.

```{r files-for-a-website-1-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like:

```
https://github.com/davidkane9/first-website
```

Always start a new data science project with a Github repo.


### Exercise 2

Connect the `first-website` Github repo to an R project on your computer. Name the R project `first-website` also. Keeping the names of repos/projects aligned makes organization simpler. 

From the Terminal, run `ls`. CP/CR.

```{r files-for-a-website-2-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like this:

```
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ ls
README.md               first-website.Rproj
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
```

The default README has an "md" suffix to indicate that it is a **M**ark**d**own document.

RStudio will automatically restart and place you within the `first-website` R project. This should be in a directory called `first-website` in the location in which you store your R projects.


### Exercise 3

In the Terminal, run `quarto create project website .`.  Don't forget the `.` at the end of the command. This indicates that the new files should be placed in the current working directory. 

This command will usually result in a restart of your RStudio instance. Or it might create a second R instance, also located in the `first-website` directory. If so, delete one of the instances. It does not matter which.

In the Console, run `list.files()`. CP/CR.

```{r files-for-a-website-3-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> list.files()
[1] "_quarto.yml"         "about.qmd"           "first-website.Rproj" "index.qmd"          
[5] "README.md"           "styles.css"         
````

Note how we can work with the current directory either from the Terminal, with commands like `ls`, or from the Console, with commands like `list.files()`.

The basic set of files necessary for making a Quarto website has been added to the current directory. Recall the `.` means the current directory while `..` means the directory one level above the current one. 


### Exercise 4

In the Console, run `list.files(all.files = TRUE)`. CP/CR. 


```{r files-for-a-website-4-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

Your answer should look something like:

```
> list.files(all.files = TRUE)
 [1] "_quarto.yml"         "."                   ".."                  ".git"               
 [5] ".gitignore"          ".Rproj.user"         "about.qmd"           "first-website.Rproj"
 [9] "index.qmd"           "README.md"           "styles.css"         
```

### 

You would get the same set of files if, in the Terminal, you ran `ls -a`. The `-a` ensures that **a**ll the files are listed, included the "hidden" ones which begin with a dot. 

### 

In general, we do not touch/manipulate "dot" directories, meaning directories whose names begin with a dot or period. Such directories are meant to be used by the operating system and other programs. For example, the program git uses the `.git` directory to store information about changes in all the files in the project. 

### Exercise 5

In the Console, run `list.files()`. The "hidden" files will no longer appear. CP/CR.

```{r files-for-a-website-5-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

A website is a more complex object than a single Quarto document. It has two main components. First is a "settings" file, `_quarto.yml`, which provides instructions for how the website should be constructed. Second are a collection of Quarto documents, like `index.qmd` and `about.qmd`, which will be rendered into the HTML files which viewers will see.


### Exercise 6

In the Console, run `readr::read_lines("_quarto.yml") |> cat(sep = "\n")`. CP/CR.


```{r files-for-a-website-6-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

YAML files are how Quarto projects tell the world what they are. In this case, the initial lines specify that this is a website.

````
project:                                   
  type: website
````

But other values for `type` are possible.

### Exercise 7

In the Console, run `readr::read_lines("_quarto.yml")[4:10] |> cat(sep = "\n")`. CP/CR.

```{r files-for-a-website-7-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

These lines provide meta-information about the website and its organization. 

````
website:                                        
  title: "."
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
````

Note that the "title" has no necessary connection to the name of our Github repo or the name of our R project. 

Indents and other whitespace matter in the interpretation of a YAML file.

### Exercise 8

In the Source pane, open the `_quarto.yml` file. Replace `title: "."` with `title: "A New Website"`. Save the file. 

In the Console, run `readr::read_lines("_quarto.yml")[4:10] |> cat(sep = "\n")`. CP/CR.

<!-- DK: Could use Terminal instead, with `tail -n +4 filename | head -n 7`. -->

```{r files-for-a-website-8-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

It is a [flaw](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/8540) in `quarto` that there is no easy way to provide a title to a new project when creating that project in the current directory.

### Exercise 9

In the Console, run `readr::read_lines("_quarto.yml")[12:16] |> cat(sep = "\n")`. CP/CR.

```{r files-for-a-website-9-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

These lines provide formatting information about the pages of the website. 

````
format:                                       
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
````

The `css` lines tells Quarto to use the `styles.css` file, located in the same directory, for the "style" of the pages.

### Exercise 10

In the Console, run `readr::read_lines("index.qmd") |> cat(sep = "\n")`. CP/CR.


```{r files-for-a-website-10-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The answer should look like:

````
---                                                                                                                                    
title: "."
---

This is a Quarto website.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.
````

Whenver a web browser goes to a directory on the internet, it looks for an `index.html` file. If found, that file is displayed. So, the `index.qmd` file, which we will soon render as `index.html` is important.

### Exercise 11

Open the `index.qmd` file in the Source pane. Replace `title: "."` with `title: "My First Website"`. Save the file.

In the Console, run `readr::read_lines("index.qmd") |> cat(sep = "\n")`. CP/CR.


```{r files-for-a-website-11-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Yes, it is a bother to have to replace `"."` twice. Very annoying! With luck, Quarto will soon allow us to specify a title when we first create these files. In the meantime, it is good to have an occasion to look closely at the files which help us to create a website.

Note that the "title" ("A New Website") in `_quarto.yml` has no necessary connection to the "title" ("My First Website") in `index.qmd`. The former is the title for the entire website. The later is the title for just the (yet-to-be-created) `index.html` page.


### Exercise 12

We don't want to put all the files on Github. So, add `*Rproj` to your `.gitignore` file. Save the file. Note that a new line, `/.quarto/` has been added to the `.gitignore`. We will discuss this file later.

In the Terminal, run `cat .gitignore`. CP/CR.

```{r files-for-a-website-12-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Good data scientists believe in transparency and reproducibility. We want people --- include "future" us --- to be able to reproduce our work. By default, almost every file belongs on Github. But settings for R projects are both not necessary for replication and often specific to each individual. 


### Exercise 13

Commit and push all the files in the project. Run `git log` in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r files-for-a-website-13-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

The output from the `git log` command is too complex for us to fully parse. If you want to learn more about how to work with git/Github and R, check out [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html), a very useful resource.


## Rendering and previewing
### 

We now have the infrastructure for our website. We want to create (or "render") the webpages themselves and then "publish" them to somewhere on the web.


### Exercise 1

From the Terminal, run `quarto render`. CP/CR.

```{r rendering-and-previewing-1-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ quarto render
[1/2] index.qmd
[2/2] about.qmd

Output created: _site/index.html

Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
````

quarto reports to us what it has done, working on our two `qmd` files and creating a new directory, `_site`, in which it has placed an `index.html` file. (I believe that it is a bug in the version of quarto I used that it does not also report the creation of `about.html`.)

### Exercise 2

From the Console, run `list.files("_site")`. CP/CR.


```{r rendering-and-previewing-2-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer will probably look something like:

````
> list.files("_site")
[1] "about.html"  "index.html"  "search.json" "site_libs"   "styles.css" 
>
````

The `about.html` and `index.html` files are simply the rendered `about.qmd` and `index.qmd` input files. They are placed into the `_site` directory because the convention, when constructing websites and other large projects is to separate out the outputs from the inputs.

The webpages which make up a website are often placed in a directory named either `_site` or `docs`, depending on the setup of your web hosting service.

We won't discuss the `search.json` and `styles.css` files. The `site_libs` directory includes many files beyond the scope of this tutorial. Basic idea is that the entire `_site` directory is a functioning website, ready to be deployed.

### Exercise 3

Add `/_site/site_libs/` to the `.gitignore` file. Save the new file. From the Console, run `readLines(".gitignore")`. CP/CR.


```{r rendering-and-previewing-3-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

This command is convenient because the `site_libs` directory contains of lot of weird files that change often enough to annoy. We don't create any of them, so we don't really need to back them up. Moreover, they will still get published directly to the web from our computer.

The initial backslash in `/_site/site_libs/` helps git to interpret `_site` correctly. See the Regular expressions tutorial for more information. `_site/site_libs/` is a directory, so it makes sense to end the expression with a backslash.


### Exercise 4

From the Terminal, run `quarto preview`. CP/CR.

```{r rendering-and-previewing-4-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like this:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ quarto preview
Preparing to preview
[1/1] index.qmd

Watching files for changes
Browse at http://localhost:7412/
GET: /
````

The preview command does two things. First, it renders the `qmd` files, just like `render` does. Second, it sets up a viewer, probably your default web browser, so that you can see what the website looks like. Click around and check it out!

The message at the end indicates that quarto is now "watching" your files to see if you make any changes. If you do, it will automatically update the website.

### Exercise 5

Look at your website in the browser. (You might need to enter the url, `http://localhost:7412/` in my case, but yours will be different, by hand.) Click on the "Home" link and then copy/paste the entire screen.


```{r rendering-and-previewing-5-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
A New Website

Home
About
My First Website
This is a Quarto website.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.
````

The title of the entire project ("A New Website"), taken from the `_quarto.yml` file, appears in the upper left hand corner. The title of the main home page ("My First Website"), taken from the `index.qmd` file, appears at the top of the Home page, which, by default, is always the `index.html` file. 


### Exercise 6

Copy/paste the url for your previewed website.

```{r rendering-and-previewing-6-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should be something like:

````
http://localhost:3358/
````

The website is being "hosted" on your computer. That is what the word "localhost" refers to. It is not available on the web.


### Exercise 7

The advantage of using preview is that the website is automatically updated whenever you edit and save the underlying QMD file. Try it by changing the `about.qmd` file, replacing "About this site" with your name. Save the file. 

At the Terminal, you should see a new message. Copy and paste it here.

```{r rendering-and-previewing-7-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like this:

````
pandoc 
  to: html
  output-file: about.html
  standalone: true
  title-prefix: A New Website
  section-divs: true
  html-math-method: mathjax
  wrap: none
  default-image-extension: png
  css:
    - styles.css
  toc: true
  
metadata
  document-css: false
  link-citations: true
  date-format: long
  lang: en
  theme: cosmo
  title: About
  
GET: /about.html

````

quarto has noticed that you changed/saved the `about.qmd` file. It rendered the new version, creating a new `about.html` which it has now *gotten* and is displaying.

### Exercise 8

Copy/paste the About page form your browser.

```{r rendering-and-previewing-8-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this, except with your name instead of mine!

````
A New Website

Home
About
About
David Kane
````

If you want to stop `quarto preview` you can cancel the command by hitting the red stop sign which is located in the upper right of the Terminal.


## Publishing
### 

To make your website publicly visible, you need to "publish" it to the web. The Quarto documentation provide a [thorough discussion](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/).

### Exercise 1

If you don't already have one, set up a [Quarto Pub](quartopub.com) account for hosting the website. 

* In your browser, type `quartopub.com`, it will take you directly to the website

* Click the big blue button that says **Sign Up**. 

* We recommend using your Github username and password. (It is much easier this way, so you don't have to juggle around a bunch of passwords and usernames when you want to publish.)

Copy/paste the web address of your Quarto Pub account.

```{r publishing-1-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

Your answer should look like this:

````
https://davidkane.quarto.pub
````

Beyond [Quarto Pub](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html), there are other free services which you can use to host your website and other data science document, examples include [GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) and [Posit Cloud](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/posit-cloud.html).


### Exercise 2

Ensure that all the files in the project have been committed and pushed. (Recall that you have, at least, edited `about.qmd` and that doing so has caused changes in other downsteam files.)

At the Terminal, type: 

`quarto publish quarto-pub` 

You will then need to hit the Enter button twice, accepting the default options for account (your email address) and site name ("a-new-website"). CP/CR.


```{r publishing-2-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 10)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````

`quarto publish`, like `quarto preview`, first renders all the files on the project. Note the phrase "Rendering for publish" in the output,  

### Exercise 3

A link to your new website should be brought up in a browser. Copy/paste the url for your website. 

```{r publishing-3-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

It should look like:

````
https://davidkane.quarto.pub/a-new-website/
````

The **quarto** package, which we have not installed, provides R commands for accomplishing these same goals. We do not use it in this tutorial.


### Exercise 4

Check your Git tab. Assuming you committed everything before running `quarto publish quarto-pub`, as instructed, it should be easy to notice the new files. Write down the name of the new YAML file, the file with `.yml` at the end.


```{r publishing-4-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The `_publish.yml` is where Quarto keeps track of publishing information. This file did not exist before because you had not published the website yet. 

There *might* also be some new files, like `_site/robots.txt` and `_site/sitemap.xml`, but, as usual, we won't worry too much about weird files in the `_site` directory.

### Exercise 5

In the Console, run `readr::read_lines("_publish.yml") |> cat(sep = "\n")`. CP/CR.

```{r publishing-5-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like:

````
> readr::read_lines("_publish.yml") |> cat(sep = "\n")
- source: project                                                                                                                      
  quarto-pub:
    - id: cfb2577e-312e-4717-892a-42b92619ebe3
      url: 'https://davidkane.quarto.pub/a-new-website'
>
````

In general, we will not edit the `_publish.yml` file directly. 

### Exercise 6

If you look closely, you will see a new directory, `.quarto`, in the Files tab. Neither this directory, nor any of the files within it, appear in the Git tab because of the `/.quarto/` line in the `.gitignore` file.

From the Console, run `list.files(".quarto")`. CP/CR.

```{r publishing-6-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The `.quarto` directory is like the `.git` and `.Rproj.user` directories. We will never look or change the files inside of them. Only the relevant programs --- quarto, R and RStudio --- should work with the contents of these directories. 


### Exercise 7

Open the `_quarto.yml` file in the Source pane. Change `title: "A New Website"` to `title: "A New Website, second edition"`. 

In the Console, run `readr::read_lines("_quarto.yml")[4:5] |> cat(sep = "\n")`. CP/CR.

```{r publishing-7-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> readr::read_lines("_quarto.yml")[4:5] |> cat(sep = "\n")
website:                                 
  title: "A New Website, second edition"
>
````

Keep track of the three different places that the title of our project now exists. First, it is present in `_quarto.yml`. We have changed it there. But we have not changed it in the `_site` files which constitute the website nor in files uploaded to Quarto Pub.


### Exercise 8

Form the Terminal, run `quarto preview`. Copy and paste the text from the home page once it comes up on your browser.

```{r publishing-8-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
A New Website, second edition

Home
About
My First Website
This is a Quarto website.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.
````

But, if you look at the Quarto Pub version of your website, it still uses the "A New Website" title because we have not (yet) published our new version. We have, however, changed the files in the `_site` directory, as you can tell by looking at the Git tab.

### Exercise 9

Stop the `quarto preview` command by hitting the red stop sign on the upper right of the Terminal tab. From the Terminal, run `quarto publish`. CP/CR.


You only need `quarto publish`, instead of `quatro publish quarto-pub` because the `_publish.yml` records that this project is published on Quarto Pub. You are simply refreshing the current project, rather than creating another.


```{r publishing-9-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ quarto publish
? Publish update to: › https://davidkane.quarto.pub/a-new-website (Quarto Pub - dave.kane@gmail.com)
Rendering for publish:

[1/2] index.qmd
[2/2] about.qmd

[✓] Published site: https://davidkane.quarto.pub/a-new-website
[✓] Account site updated: https://davidkane.quarto.pub

Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
````

Note that, even though we have changed the `title` in the `_quarto.yml` file, this change has not affected the url for the project, which still ends with `a-new-website`. Quarto Pub will select the title of the project as the url "slug" when the project is first created, but it won't change that url even if you change the title of the project.


### Exercise 10

Add `_publish.yml` to the `.gitignore` file. From the Console, run `readLines(".gitignore")`. CP/CR.

```{r publishing-10-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The `_publish.yml` file is like the `first-website.Rproj` file. In *theory*, they might contain private information of some sort, like logins or passwords, and so do not belong on Github. But, in reality, [they rarely](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/rstudio-connect.html#publish-command) do. Still, we like you to practice the editing of configuration files like `.gitignore`.

### Exercise 11

Commit and push all the files in the project. Run `git log` in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r publishing-11-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Note both the simplicity *and* the complexity of your project. It is simple in that, even if our computer blew up we would be able to recreate everything from the files on Github. It is complex in that there are a lot of files, interacting in a fairly sophisticated fashion.

Sam Csik provides an [excellent overview](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/) of the entire process of creating Quarto websites. Note her use of Github Pages instead of Quarto Pub.

## Adding a plot
### 

Let's add a visualization for your website by modifying `index.qmd`. Recall that this file will always create our "home" page because it is rendered to `index.html`. Browsers, by default, show `index.html`, if one exists, when they visit a new directory. 

### 

We are going to add the following plot to your website's home page.

```{r}
diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(title = "Prices and Sizes for Diamonds of Color D",
         subtitle = "'Round' carat values like 1, 1.5 and 2 are more common.",
         x = "Carat",
         y = "Price")
```

### Exercise 1

Delete everything in `index.qmd` except for the `title: "My First Website"` surrounded by the three dashes, above and below. Run `head index.qmd` in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r adding-a-plot-1-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

The material bracketed by the three dashes at the very top is called a **YAML Header**. These are very sensitive about all sorts of subtle formatting issues. `head` is a terminal command which shows the top (or "head") of a file.

As you build the website, we will ask you to share the updated files, using Terminal commands like `head`, `tail` and `cat`. `tail` shows the end (or "tail") of the file. Both `head` and `tail` take an argument `-n` which allows you to specify the number of lines from the file to show.

### Exercise 2

Create a new code chunk in `index.qmd` and load the **tidyverse** package. Render the document by pressing the Render button at the top of the Source pane. If your website is still being previewed, this will update the displayed homepage automatically.

In other words, you might not have to run `quarto preview` from the Terminal. Just rendering `index.qmd` directly is often enough.

Copy and paste the new home page, leaving out the menu items.

```{r adding-a-plot-2-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

You answer should look like this:

````
My First Website
library(tidyverse)

── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5
✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1
✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1

✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
ℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors
````

Because we have not yet added any code chunk options, the code is echoed and the package startup messages displayed.


### Exercise 3

Create another code chunk. Add this code to it:

````
diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(title = "Prices and Sizes for Diamonds of Color D",
         subtitle = "'Round' carat values like 1, 1.5 and 2 are more common.",
         x = "Carat",
         y = "Price")
````

Save the file. From the Terminal, run `tail index.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-a-plot-3-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Render the page. You will see a nice plot, along with a lot of junk code and messages. 


### Exercise 4

Add these code chunk options to the top of the first code chunk, the one which loads the library.

````
# | message: false
# | echo: false
# | label: setup
````

In the Terminal, run `head index.qmd `. CP/CR.

```{r adding-visualizations-ex-4}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Code that works during your R session will not work when your website is rendered if you have not loaded the required libraries into the document. But our readers don't want to see that code, much less the messages which it produces. So, we hide them.

You are generally free to label your chunks however you like, but there is one chunk name that imbues special behavior in RStudio: `setup`. When you first open a Quarto document, the chunk named `setup`, if there is one, will be run automatically once, before any other code is run.


### Exercise 5

In the second code chunk, add the following options:

````
# | echo: false
# | label: diamonds-plot
````

Save the changes to `index.qmd`. In the Terminal, run `tail index.qmd `. CP/CR.

```{r adding-visualizations-ex-5}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Assigning labels to code chunks helps keeps you organized and helps others understand your code. You cannot assign the same label to multiple code chunks. 

Your chunk labels should be short but evocative and should not contain spaces. We recommend using dashes (-) to separate words (instead of underscores, _) and avoiding other special characters in chunk labels.

### Exercise 6

Render the `index.qmd` with the Render button. It should show the plot. You could also render with `Command/Ctrl + Shift + K`.

In the Terminal, run `cat index.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-visualizations-ex-6}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 12)
```

### 

There are two common modes for working with larger projects. First, as here, we work with an individual file, like `index.qmd`, and ensure that it is working as we want. Second, as before, we work with the project as a whole, using commands like `quarto render` and `quarto preview`. The former approach is quickest and is how we spend most of our time. But, at the end of the day, we need to build the entire project.

### Exercise 7

It is annoying to use the same code chunk option in every code chunk. In `index.qmd`, both code chunks contain `#| echo: false`. Delete both of them. Edit the YAML header so that it includes:

````
execute: 
  echo: false
````

In the Terminal, run `head -n 5 index.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-a-plot-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ head -n 5 index.qmd
---
title: "My First Website"
execute: 
  echo: false
---
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
````

If you added `echo: false` as an `execute` argument in `_quarto.yml`, this would affect all the QMD files in the entire project. In other words, you can set an option like `echo` in three places: individual code chunk, entire QMD file, or entire project. Options set at higher levels can be overruled by changing the setting at a lower level.


### Exercise 7

Go to the Git tab, then commit and push your new changes to Github. Include a descriptive commit message, e.g. "Added plot to home page".

In the Terminal,run `quarto publish`. You don't need to include `quarto-pub` since that information now appears in the `_publish.yml` file. You will need to hit Enter once.

It will not bring you to your website, but to your Quarto Pub account, where you will see the website address. Click on it and copy and paste the URL below:

```{r adding-visualizations-ex-7}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
https://davidkane.quarto.pub/a-new-website/
````

Keep track of the three different versions of the website. 

First, we have the QMD files in the project directory which are used to create the website. This is the original source, the place where changes should be made. 

Second, we have the rendered version of the files which reside in the `_site` directory on our computer. We do not edit these files directly, but we do look at them when we are "previewing" the website.

Third, we have the website itself, the files which other people can see. These reside on Quarto Pub, in this case, but we could put them on a different hosting service.


## Adding text
### 

<!-- DK: Could drop this section withoit losing much. -->

Quarto allows for a combination of plain text and R code. This same feature allows you to add plain text to your website.

### Exercise 1

Open `about.qmd `. Delete all the current text, except for the YAML header. Change the `title` from your name to just `"About"`. Add `## About Me` as the first (and only) line of text. Render the QMD. In the Terminal, run `cat about.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-text-1-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Hash signs in front of text makes the text into a header. The organization of headers is determined by the number of hash signs. Fewer hash signs make higher level headers, i.e. bigger text. More hash signs make lower level headers, i.e. smaller text. 


### Exercise 2

Write a one sentence description yourself. Write it below the header. Include your name and school, either the one you attend or one from which you have graduated. Write until the end of the line, i.e. do not use the Enter key to wrap text. When you are finished, render the QMD. Example:

````
My name is David Kane, and I graduated from Williams College.
````

In the Terminal, run `cat about.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-text-2-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

You can have a Quarto document without a YAML header, if you like. You can also have an empty YAML header. But, it will often be the case that we want all the files in a project to have similar YAML headers in order to create a consistent look-and-feel.


### Exercise 3

Let's bold your name. In the description you have already written, surround your name with two asterisks (** **) on each side. Example:

````
My name is **David Kane**, and I graduated from Williams College.
````

Save the file. Render the QMD. In the Terminal, run `cat about.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-text-3-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Quarto, which is based on the Markdown language, has a variety of [formatting options](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

### Exercise 4

Add a new header at the bottom of `about.qmd`, using two hash signs, "About the project". Underneath the header, add a sentence about a hypothetical data science project, ideally one that you are actively considering. Include the title of your project in the sentence. Example:

````
In my project, "The Birth Months of Elite Footballers," I explore the distribution of the months --- like January versus June --- in which professional football/soccer players were born.
````

Save the file. Render the QMD. In the Terminal, run `cat about.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-text-4-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Examples of Quarto formatting options incclude:

````
**bold** *italic* ~~strikeout~~ `code`

superscript^2^ subscript~2~

[underline]{.underline} [small caps]{.smallcaps}
````

<!-- DK: Can we make the format of the above look like the below? Like put them both in boxes? Right now, only the raw test is in a box, becasuse of the four backticks. -->

These look like:

**bold** *italic* ~~strikeout~~ `code`

superscript^2^ subscript~2~

[underline]{.underline} [small caps]{.smallcaps}


### Exercise 5

Italicize the title of your project by replacing each quotation mark with an asterisk. Example:

````
In my project, *The Birth Months of Elite Footballer*, I explore the distribution of the months --- like January versus June --- in which professional football/soccer players were born.
````

Save the file. Render the QMD. In the Terminal, run `grep "*" about.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-text-5-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

We need to include the quotes around `*` in order to cause `grep` to treat it as a simple character, rather than the wild card character associated with regular expressions.


### Exercise 6

Oftentimes you want to wrap text before the default margin. For example, add Preceptor's common saying: `"You can never restart R too often."` to the `about.qmd` file. Then on the next line add `-- Preceptor`. Render the QMD.

### 

Run `grep  "-" about.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-text-6-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

As you can see in the rendered HTML page, the quote and its source have ended up on the same line because Quarto assumes that anything without an explicit line break can be placed in to the same paragraph.

### Exercise 7

To create a manual line break, separate `"You can never restart R too often."` and `-- Preceptor` with a backslash, like this:

````
"You can never restart R too often."
\
~ Preceptor
````

Render the QMD. In the Terminal, run `tail about.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-text-7-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

A backslash is the Quarto manual line break. 

### Exercise 8

Let's create text which is also a hyperlink to the a website. Enclose the text "Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp" in brackets `[]`. Then, without a space intervening, add parentheses `()` which enclose a link to the relevant website: `https://bootcamp.davidkane.info`. Add this to the bottom of `about.qmd`.

It should look like:

````
[Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info)
````

### 

Render the QMD. In the Terminal, run `tail about.qmd`. CP/CR.


```{r adding-text-8-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

You only need a few [formatting tricks](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) for working with Quarto files, but you will use those tricks repeatedly.


### Exercise 9

Push all the changes to Git, and issue the `quarto publish` command in the Terminal. You need to hit Enter at least once. CP/CR.

```{r adding-text-9-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Troubleshooting Quarto documents can be challenging because you are no longer in an interactive R environment, and you will need to learn some new tricks. Additionally, the error could be due to issues with the Quarto document itself or due to the R code in the Quarto document.

If the errors are due to the R code in the document, the first thing you should always try is to recreate the problem in an interactive session. Restart R, then “Run all chunks”, either from the Code menu, under Run region or with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + R`. If you’re lucky, that will recreate the problem, and you can figure out what’s going on interactively.

## Adding new pages
### 

Here you will learn how to create new pages for your website, accessible via the navigation bar at the top.

### Exercise 1

Go to `File -> New File -> Quarto Document...`. Title it "Sources". Select "Create Empty Document" (in the bottom left corner). Save the file, changing the file name from `Untitled.qmd` to `sources.qmd`. 

### 

In the Terminal, run `ls *qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-1-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

You should see `index.qmd`, `about.qmd`, and `sources.qmd` in the output. If not, make sure you are in the `first-website` directory. The `*qmd` regular expression selects only files with names which end with the letters `qmd`.

### Exercise 2

In the `sources.qmd` file, below the YAML header, add the text `An overview of sources used in my project.` 

In the Terminal, run the command `grep overview sources.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-2-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

`grep` is handy for finding just those lines in the target file which match the provided pattern.


### Exercise 3

Add the following sentence: 

````
These are my sources. Here are some challenges. Quarto websites are awesome.
````

Render `sources.qmd`. Run `cat sources.qmd` in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-3-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

A website, when you first look closely, may appear overwhelming in its complexity. But it is usually created from of a simple collection of text files, each of them quite simple.

### Exercise 4

Open the `_quarto.yml` file. You should see a line that says `navbar`. Below this line you should see the line `left`. Below this is the code that creates the header links for the navigation bar on your site. It should look like:


```
website:
  title: "A New Website, second edition"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
```
    

### 

To add `sources.qmd` as a new page which will appear on the menu, we need to edit this as follows:

```
website:
  title: "first-website"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
      - href: sources.qmd
        text: Sources
```

Note the two additional lines. 

The `href` line tells Quarto to create an HTML page by rendering `sources.qmd` and to include that new page in the website. 

The `text` line tells Quarto to format the link in the **nav**igation tool**bar** as `Sources`. This is the same process by which the home page, created from `index.qmd`, has a link labeled `Home`.

Make the formatting and spacing match the preceding items in the navbar. **YAML files can be very persnickety when it comes to formatting!** When you are done, save `_quarto.yml`.

Since `- about.qmd` appears without either the `href` or `text` argument, Quarto assumes that you want to the link to be the same as the title of the QMD. 

<!-- DK: Is this true? Explain this better. -->

### 

In the Terminal, run `cat _quarto.yml`. CP/CR

```{r adding-new-pages-4-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

**YAML files are *very* tricky!** Tabs and white spaces matter. The code `left` before the navbar items puts the navigation bar on the left side of your site. This can be changed to `right``.


### Exercise 5

Run `quarto publish` from the Terminal. You will need to hit Enter once. Check out your new project! See how "Sources" now appears on the navigation toolbar. Click on "Sources" and see how the text you added to `sources.qmd` now appears on the web.

Run `ls _site/*html` in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-5-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

You should see several HTML pages, including `sources.html`. Quarto websites, like many similar frameworks, place all the pages which appear on the web into a single directory, like `_site` and then move that directory onto a hosting service like Quarto Pub.

<!-- DK: This comment is repetitive. -->

### Exercise 6

In the `_quarto.yml` file, delete the two lines of code that create the link and header for the Sources page.

In the Terminal, use `rm` to remove `sources.qmd`. Run `ls` in the Terminal again. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-6-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

There should not be a `sources.qmd` file. We are practicing these skills to make you more comfortable building up and tearing down the parts of a project. You need to build more than one house to get good at house-building!

### Exercise 7

Make two more Quarto documents in the same way as you did above. 

You should save them both (so they're not `untitled1` and `untitled2`). Name them `source-1.qmd` and `source-2.qmd`. In the YAML heading at the top of both documents, change the titles to `"Source 1"` and `"Source 2"`.

In the Terminal, run the command `head source-1.qmd source-2.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-7-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

In many Terminal commands, you can provide more than one file as the target of the command. In this case, `head` will be applied to `source-1.qmd` and then `source-2.qmd` sequentially.


### Exercise 8

Let's create a drop-down menu called "Sources" through which one could visit either the page for "Source 1" or "Source 2" from the top menu.

We will be messing around with YAML settings to make this, so pay very close attention

The Quarto [documentation](https://quarto.org/) provides an [excellent overview](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html) of approaches to website navigation. 

Change `_quarto.yml` so that the `navbar` section looks like this


````
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - text: Sources
        menu:
          - href: sources-1.qmd
            text: Source 1
          - href: sources-2.qmd
            text: Source 2 
      - about.qmd
````        

In the Terminal, run `cat _quarto.yml`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-8-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 10)
```

### 

Run `quarto preview` to see the changes. 


### Exercise 9

Go the Git tab, then commit and push your new changes to Github. Include a descriptive commit message, e.g. "Added source pages".


After pushing, type `quarto publish` in the Terminal and hit Enter.


## Using an RDS file
### 

An RDS file allows us to save any R object in a file. When we read from an RDS, we avoid having to run the code which created the object again. Instead, we simply have access to the object. This is very convenient for any code which takes a long time to run, such as intensive data manipulation.

Restart your R session with `Command/Ctrl + Shift + 0`.

### Exercise 1

Go to `File -> New File -> R Script`. Save the file. Name the file `process_data.R`. The `.R` suffix will be added automatically.

In the Terminal, run `ls`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-1-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

Make sure that `process_data.R` is one of these files. We often use scripts to to record the exact steps we used in analyzing some data or in creating a graphic. We want our work to be reproducible. We will often need to perform the same work again, albeit with some changes. A script can make that much simpler.

### Exercise 2

Though an R script will use the libraries you already have loaded if executed interactively in the Console, it is good practice to include these at the top of the script. Any script you create should run correctly, even if you have just re-started R.

In the R script, load the **tidyverse** package using the `library()` command. 

In the Terminal, run `cat process_data.R`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-2-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

Because this is a script, you don't need to create a code chunk. Scripts are most useful for work which simply creates an object, often a new data set or a graphic. 

### Exercise 3

Skip a line after `library(tidverse)`. Again, this is a script, so there are no code chunks, but skipping a line in between substantively different parts of the code is a good idea. Add this code:

````
diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") 
````

In the Terminal, run `cat process_data.R`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-3-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

The answer should look like this:

````
library(tidyverse)

diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") 
````

You should try to learn how to work in two ways. First is interactively, trying things at the Console. Seeing what happens. Going line-by-line. Second is writtenly, adding code to your script/QMD and then executing all the code at once. Of course, the best approach is to use these two methods at the same time. 

### Exercise 4

Place your cursor in `process_data.R` at `filter(z != 0) |>`. Hit `Command/Ctrl + Enter`. (Note that this should generate an error.) CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-4-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The cause of the error is the distinction between the two worlds: the world of the Console and the world of the Script. The Script includes `library(tidyverse)`. So, when you source `process_data.R` in the next question, everything works fine. The Console, however, knows nothing about the `diamonds` tibble or about commands like `select()` or `filter()`. Recall that we recently restarted R. So, the **tidyverse** library, which contains `diamonds` and those commands, has not been loaded in the Console. 

A line of code, like `library(tidyverse)`, might exist in a script, but unless/until that line is executed in the Console, the Console won't know anything about it.


### Exercise 5

"Source" the entire script by pressing the "Source" button on the upper right. This takes all the code from the script and feeds it, line-by-line, to the R Console. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-5-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 10)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````

# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows

````

The output of the pipe is our new tibble with 6,764 rows.


### Exercise 6

Change the code so that the pipe, instead of just vomiting out its result for printing, assigns that result to a new object, named `D_diamonds`. Your script should look like:

````
library(tidyverse)

D_diamonds <- diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") 
````

Source the new script. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-ex-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
> source("~/Desktop/projects/first-website/process_data.R", echo=TRUE)

> library(tidyverse)

> D_diamonds <- diamonds |> 
+   filter(z != 0) |> 
+   filter(color == "D") 
>
````

Notice how different this looks from the previous output. 

First, none of the messages associated with the **tidyverse** package are displayed. R only shows these messages the first time you load the package in a session. 

Second, the rows of the tibble are not shown because the pipe no longer just vomits them out at the end. Instead, the results of the pipe are assigned to a new object: `D_diamonds`. Assignment does not result in printed output. 


### Exercise 7

From the Console, run `ls()`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-ex-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
> ls()
[1] "D_diamonds"
> 
````

### 

We have created a new object in the environment called `D_diamonds`. You can also see this object if you click on the Environment tab within the Environment pane. The name `D_diamonds` is meant to remind us that all the diamonds in this tibble are of color D.


### Exercise 8

Restart your R session again. You can never restart your R session too often! The best way to do this is with the shortcut command: `Command/Ctrl + Shift + 0`. (This is the number zero, not the letter "O.")

From the Console, run `ls()`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-ex-8}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> ls()
character(0)
> 
````

`D_diamonds` has disappeared! Objects in the R environment vanish once R restarts. And that is OK! We have the script, `process_data.R`, which allows us to recreate the object whenever we want.

### Exercise 9

Source `process_data.R`. From the Console, run `ls()`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-ex-9}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

`D_diamonds` is back! If you type `D_diamonds` at the Console and hit `Enter`, the contents of the tibble will appear.

### Exercise 10

It is often useful to save a permanent copy of an R object like a plot or a tibble. [`write_rds()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_rds.html) from the **readr** package is the most common approach for tibbles.

From the Console, run `write_rds(D_diamonds, file = "clean_data.rds")`. This function does not produce any output. The first argument is the R object(s) which you want to save. The second argument is the name of the file which will hold that object.

From the Console, run `list.files(pattern = "clean")`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-ex-10}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> list.files(pattern = "clean")
[1] "clean_data.rds"
> 
````

The `pattern` argument to `list.files()` allows us to only look for files which match a regular expression.

There are now three objects associated with our tibble. The first is the script, `process_data.R`, which we used to create it. The second is the R object, `D_diamonds`, which only exists in the R session in which it was created. The third is the RDS object, `clean_data.rds`, which contains the data and which continues to exist even after the R session ends. Indeed, the RDS object can be committed and pushed to Github. (But be careful of pushing large objects (greater than 100 megabytes) to Github.)


### Exercise 11

Restart your R session with `Command/Ctrl + Shift + 0`. When R restarts, you should still be in the `first-website` project. At the Console, run `library(tidyverse)`. We need to reload the **tidyverse** every time we restart R.

At the Console, run `read_rds("clean_data.rds")`. CP/CR.


```{r using-an-rds-file-ex-11}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> read_rds("clean_data.rds")
# A tibble: 6,774 × 10

# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
> 
````

The value returned by `read_rds()` is whatever is contained in the RDS object. In this case, that is a tibble. But, when the object at the Console is a tibble, the contents of the tibble are just printed out, as here.


### Exercise 12

Open the `process_data`.R` script. At the bottom, as this line:

````
write_rds(D_diamonds, file = "clean_data.rds")
````

It is separate from, and unconnected to, the pipe which creates the `D_diamonds` tibble. 

From the Terminal, run `cat process_data.R`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-ex-12}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ cat process_data.R
library(tidyverse)

D_diamonds <- diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") 

write_rds(D_diamonds, file = "clean_data.rds")
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
````

This is a common approach to scripts which are parts of larger projects. They finish by creating an object which is then used by other code in the project.

### Exercise 13

Source `process_data.R`. The easiest way of doing so, as before, is to open the file in the Source pane and then click the "Source" button.

In the Terminal, run `ls clean*`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-ex-13}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ ls clean*
clean_data.rds
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
````

`clean*` is a regular expression which matches any file which begins with the letters `clean`. 


## Using a PNG file
### 

A PNG file allows us to save any R graphic in a file. When we use a PNG, we avoid having to re-run the code which created it. This is very convenient for graphics which take a long time to create.

### Exercise 1

Go to `File -> New File -> R Script`. Press save in the left of the top panel. Name the file `make_plot.R`. The `.R` suffix will be added automatically.

In the Terminal, run `ls`. CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-1-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

Make sure that `make_plot.R` is one of these files. We often use scripts to to record the exact steps we used in creating a graphic. We want our work to be reproducible. We will often need to perform the same work again, albeit with some small changes. A script can make that much simpler.

### Exercise 2

Though an R script will use the libraries you already have loaded if executed interactively in the Console, it is good practice to include these at the top of the script. Any script you create should run correctly, even if you have just re-started R.

In the R script, load the **tidyverse** package using the `library()` command. 

In the Terminal, run `cat make_plot.R`. CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-2-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Naming conventions are important. It is fine to have dashes in a code chunk label. However, any object which might be used from the Terminal, like the name of a script, should avoid dashes because the Terminal interprets a dash as a special character, not as part of the file name. 

### Exercise 3

Copy this code into `make_plot.R`, below `library(tidyverse)`.  Save the R script.

````
x <- read_rds("clean_data.rds")

x |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(title = "Prices and Sizes for Diamonds of Color D",
         subtitle = "'Round' carat values like 1, 1.5 and 2 are more common.",
         x = "Carat",
         y = "Price")
````

In the Terminal, run `cat make_plot.R`. CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-3-ex}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

The answer should look like this:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ cat make_plot.R 
library(tidyverse)

x <- read_rds("clean_data.rds")

x |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(title = "Prices and Sizes for Diamonds of Color D",
         subtitle = "'Round' carat values like 1, 1.5 and 2 are more common.",
         x = "Carat",
         y = "Price")
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
````

The code does two things. 

First, it reads the tibble from `clean_data.rds` and assigns that tibble to `x`. (The fact that, in our `process_data.R` script, this data was named `D_diamonds` is irrelevant. `write_rds()` just saves the tibble, not the *name* of the tibble.)

Second, it starts a new pipe with `x` and then creates our plot. Because the plot is not assigned to an object, it is just spat back out, and then shows up in the Plots tab.

### Exercise 4

"Source" the entire script by pressing the "Source" button. This takes all the code from the script and feeds it, line-by-line, to the R Console. CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-4-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> source("~/Desktop/projects/first-website/make_plot.R", echo=TRUE)

> library(tidyverse)

> x <- read_rds("clean_data.rds")

> x |> 
+   ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
+     geom_point() +
+     scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
+     labs(titl .... [TRUNCATED] 
> 
````

At this point, we face the same problem as we faced when working on `process_data.R`. The script creates the object, in this case a graphic, which we want. But we need a way to save a permanent copy of that object.

### Exercise 5

Edit `make_plot.R` in two ways. First, assign the plot to an object named `D_plot`. Second, insert, after the graphic pipe, `ggsave("size_v_weight.png", D_plot)`. 

From the Terminal, run `cat make_plot.R`. CP/CR. 

```{r using-a-png-file-5-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 8)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ cat make_plot.R 
library(tidyverse)

x <- read_rds("clean_data.rds")

D_plot <- x |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(title = "Prices and Sizes for Diamonds of Color D",
         subtitle = "'Round' carat values like 1, 1.5 and 2 are more common.",
         x = "Carat",
         y = "Price")

ggsave("size_v_weight.png", D_plot)
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
````

As with `clean_data.R`, we have created a script which encapsulates, from start-to-finish, a discrete step in our analysis. In this case, we start from the tibble saved in `clean_data.rds` and finish by saving a graphic in `size_v_weight.png`.

### Exercise 6

Source `make_plot.R`. From the Console, run `list.files()`. CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-6-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
> list.files()
 [1] "_publish.yml"        "_quarto.yml"         "_site"               "about.qmd"          
 [5] "clean_data.rds"      "first-website.Rproj" "index.qmd"           "make_plot.R"        
 [9] "process_data.R"      "README.md"           "size_v_weight.png"   "sources-1.qmd"      
[13] "sources-2.qmd"       "sources.qmd"         "styles.css"         
> 
````

That is a lot of files! Note the new script `make_plot.R`, the object with which it starts, `clean_data.rds`, and the object which it creates, `size_v_weight.png`. 


### Exercise 7

Open the `index.qmd` file. In the `setup` code chunk, add `library(knitr)`. In the second code chunk, delete all the plotting code. Replace it all with `knitr::include_graphics("size_v_weight.png")`. Save the file.

In the Terminal, run `cat index.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-7-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ cat index.qmd 
---
title: "My First Website"
execute: 
  echo: false
---

```{r}
#| message: false
#| label: setup

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

```{r}
#| label: diamonds-plot

knitr::include_graphics("size_v_weight.png")
```

Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
````


There was nothing wrong, *per se* with having the plotting code in `index.qmd` rather than `make_plot.R`. The problem arises when that plotting code takes a long time to run, as it often will. We don't want to re-run all the code each time we make a small change to the website. It is much better to separate out the plotting code and only run it when we need to.

### Exercise 8

From the Terminal, run `quarto publish`. You will need to hit `return/enter` at least once. CP/CR.


```{r using-a-png-file-8-ex}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ quarto publish

Davids-MBP:first-website dkane$ 
````

Note the workflow. At the start, we created a pipe in `index.qmd` which does everything and then, later, we moved the code into separate scripts so that we don't need to run all the analysis each time we rebuild the website. This is a very common approach. First, get something working. Second, organize and clean it all up. 

In a complex project, we will often create directories --- like `code`, `data`, and `images` --- into which we will place files like `process_data.R`, `clean_data.rds`, and `size_v_weight.png`, respectively.


## Summary
### 

This tutorial covered material from [Chapter 28 Quarto](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) and [Chapter 29 Quarto formats](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto-formats.html) in [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, although much of the information from Chapter 28 has already appeared in the "RStudio and Github" tutorial in this package. We went go into much more detail with regard to the creation and organization of [Quarto websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/). We learned about Quarto commands like `quarto create`, `quarto render`, `quarto preview` and `quarto publish`, all of which are run from the Terminal.

Sam Csik provides an [excellent overview](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/) of the entire process of creating Quarto websites.
