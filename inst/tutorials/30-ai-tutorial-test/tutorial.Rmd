## Introduction
### 

This tutorial covers [R for Datas Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. You will learn how to plot data from the **babynames** package.


<!-- DK: Comment on chapters you are targetting. 12 through 16 -->

## Plotting babynames
### 

In this section we are going to focus on generating code to create a graph based on our dataset called `babynames`. The `babynames` is a dataset which contained names used for babies from 1880 to 2017. If you want to explore the related data, checkout [popular baby names](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). We will be using AI to generate the code for us and then we will break down the functions within the code and how they work.


### Exercise 1

Create a Github repo called `plotting-babynames`. Make sure to click the "Add a README file" check box.

Connect the repo to a project on your computer using `File -> New Folder from Git ...`. Make sure to select the "Open in a new window" box. 

You need two Positon windows: this one for running the tutorial and the one you just created for writing your code and interacting with the Console.

Select `File -> New File -> Quarto Document ...`. Provide a title -- `"Baby Names"` -- and an author (you). Render the document and save it as `analysis.qmd`.

Create a `.gitignore` file with `analysis_files` on the first line and then a blank line. Save and push.

In the Console, run:

```         
show_file(".gitignore")
```

If that fails, it is probably because you have not yet loaded `library(tutorial.helpers)` in the Console.

CP/CR.

```{r ai-usage-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Professionals keep their data science work in the cloud because laptops fail.


### Exercise 2

Load the **tidyverse** library in your QMD. Then hit `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` on that line to run it in the Console. CP/CR.

```{r ai-usage-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

###




### Exercise 3

Install the dataset we will use today: **babynames**. Run `install.packages(babynames)` in your Console. CP/CR.

```{r ai-usage-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

###

Babynames is the dataset that we will be working with today. 


### Exercise 4

Load the **babynames** dataset in your QMD with the `library()` function. CP/CR

```{r ai-usage-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

###

We load babynames into our current QMD so it is accessible to use with the rest of the code in the document.


### Exercise 5

Print out **babynames** in the Console to view the dataset. CP/CR

```{r ai-usage-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 8)
```

###

Typing out babynames is the same as typing out `print(babynames)`. Either way, we can see the same tibble. Look around and try to understand each column.


### Exercise 6

Using your favorite AI, prompt it to generate R code that takes the **babynames** and filters out all names that have a first name starting with A. Make sure to provide a tibble of **babynames** for the AI to use. Add the code to your QMD and render to check if it works. CP/CR the code.

```{r ai-usage-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 4)
```

###

Here is our genderated code:

```
a_names <- babynames %>%
  filter(str_starts(name, "A"))
```

The `filter()` function is used for subsetting data frames by selecting rows that satisfy specific conditions. In this case, it takes rows using `str_starts()` (a string function we covered earlier), which essentially takes a column (name), and selects the rows where the string of name starts with A.

###

Replace your code with ours to follow along with the tutorial.


### Exercise 7

Next, prompt AI to generate R code that makes a new subset with the total proportion of babies with first names starting with A for each sex, from each year.

```{r ai-usage-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 5)
```

###

Here is our generated code:

```
a_summary <- a_names %>%
  group_by(year, sex) %>%
  summarise(total_prop = sum(prop), .groups = "drop")
```

The function `group_by()` allows us to split a data frame into groups based on one or more variables, and then apply a function to each group to manipulate our data. Then, `summarize()` creates a new data frame with rows, in this case each row is a year and sex combination with the total proportion of names starting with A.

###

Replace your code with ours to follow along with the tutorial.


### Exercise 8

Now, using the same AI and the code above, ask it to generate R code that plots a basic graph showing the proportion of names starting with A over the years for each sex. CP/CR your code.

```{r ai-usage-8}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 10)
```

###

Here is our generated code:

```
ggplot(a_summary, aes(x = year, y = total_prop, color = sex)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of Babies with Names Starting with 'A' Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion",
    color = "Sex"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

###

Take the code we have provided you, and add it to your QMD. Now you should have a code chunk that loads **babynames**, filters it, and creates a plot based off of it. Render it to check that it works. We will now dissect the code that plots the data.


### Exercise 9

Find the line with `ggplot()` and `aes()`. Run `?ggplot` and `?aes` within the console to see what the functions do. In a few sentences of your own words, describe what they do and what arguments they take.

```{r ai-usage-9}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

###

`ggplot()` creates the basis for the graph while `aes()` maps the arguments x and y to the axis. Changing the variables set to x and y will change what is plotted.


### Exercise 10

Next, find the line with `geom_line()`. Run ?geom_line to find out what it does. Then, using AI or Google, find other geom_*() functions and learn what they do. Pick 3 functions and describe with a sentence each below.

```{r ai-usage-10}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 5)
```

###

Arguments within `geom_line()` change the appearance of the graph, but will not change the type of graph. The function `geom_line()` is what gives the plotted line on the graph. To make it a histogram, use `geom_histogram()`, to make a scatterplot, `use geom_point()`, etc.


### Exercise 11

Next, find the line with `labs()` and the lines following it containings its arguments. If not already there, add `caption = ""` and `subtitle = ""`. Change around the names of the titles. CP/CR your complete `labs()` function.

```{r ai-usage-11}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 5)
```

###

The function `labs()` provides titles and labels to the graph. The title should capture the purpose of your graph, the subtitle should be a noticeable takeaway, the x and y axis should be fitting labels with units, and the caption should give the source of the data.


### Exercise 12

Now, we are going to create a new title using string functions. Using AI, ask it to generate code for creating the title of your plot using the the function `str_c()` and assign it to the variable title1. The title should stay the same, but they way it is made should be through `str_c()`. CP/CR.

```{r ai-usage-12}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

###

Here is our generated code:

```
title1 <- str_c("Proportion of Babies with Names Starting with ", "'A'", " Over Time")
```

The function `str_c()` takes any number of vectors as arguments and returns a character vector. It essentially combines arguments of the same type into a string. 


###

Copy and paste our generated code into your QMD. Insert it right before the call to `ggplot()`. Then, set the argument `title` equal to `title1` within the call to `labs()`.


###

If you were to not use `str_c()`, double quotes "" or single quotes '' will also create a string. You can add a quote within the string by typing a backslash '\'. To add a backslash, just type another backslash before the backslash you want to add.


### Exercise 13

Now, we are going to do the same, but for a subtitle, and we will use str_glue(). Using AI, ask it to generate code for creating the subtitle of your plot using the the function `str_glue()` and assign it to the variable subtitle1. The subtitle should stay the same, but they way it is made should be through `str_glue()`. Our subtitle is: Data from 1880 to 2017 shows that the proportion was lowest around the 1950s. CP/CR.

```{r ai-usage-13}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 4)
```

###

Here is our generated code:

```
subtitle1 <- str_glue(
  "Data from {min(a_summary$year)} to {max(a_summary$year)} shows that the proportion was lowest around the 1950s"
)
```

The function `str_glue()` is an alternative to `str_c()` that evaluates anything inside {} like itâ€™s outside of the quotes. However, the function converts missing values to the string "NA."

###

Copy and paste our generated code into your QMD. Insert it right before the call to `ggplot()`. Then, set the argument `subtitle` equal to `subtitle1` within the call to `labs()`.


### Exercise 14

Using the same AI, ask it to generate code for creating an insight of your plot. Here is the prompt we used: using `str_flatten()` on the babynames dataset, make another unique insight related to the plot we have already made. Insert your plot code if needed. CP/CR.

```{r ai-usage-14}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 12)
```

###

Here is our generated code:

```
top_a_1950 <- babynames %>%
  filter(year == 1950, str_starts(name, "A")) %>%
  arrange(desc(prop)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 5)

insight_text <- top_a_1950 %>%
  pull(name) %>%
  str_flatten(collapse = ", ", last = " and ")

insight <- str_c(
  "In 1950, the most common 'A' names were ", insight_text, 
  ", which drove the total proportion for that year."
)
insight
```

The function `str_flatten()` takes a character vector and combines each element of the vector into a single string. It works well with the function `summarize()`.

###

In a new code chunk after the graph, copy and paste our generated code into your QMD. Render it with `Cmd/Ctrl + K` to ensure it works.


### Exercise 15

Using the same AI, ask it to generate code that will find the most common second letters of babynames starting with "A" with the function `separate_longer_delim()`. CP/CR.

```{r ai-usage-15}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 8)
```

###

Here is our generated code:

```
babynames %>%
  filter(str_starts(name, "A")) %>%
  separate_longer_delim(name, delim = '') %>%
  group_by(name, year, sex) %>%
  mutate(pos = row_number()) %>%
  filter(pos == 2) %>%
  count(letter = name, sort = TRUE)
```

The function `separate_longer_delim(col, delim)` makes the input data frame longer through increased rows, with the string split up through a specified deliminator as an argument.

###

In a new code cell below the previous cells, copy and paste our generated code. Then, try runninig our code in the console using `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter`! If needed, isolate the part with the relavant function, and only run the code up to that section with `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to see what the function changed.



### Exercise 16

Using the same AI, ask it to generate similar code that will find the most common second letters of babynames starting with "A" with the function `separate_longer_position()`. CP/CR.

```{r ai-usage-16}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 8)
```

###

Here is our generated code:

```
babynames %>%
  filter(str_starts(name, "A")) %>%
  separate_longer_position(name, width = 1) %>%
  group_by(name, year, sex) %>%
  mutate(pos = row_number()) %>%
  filter(pos == 2) %>%
  count(letter = name, sort = TRUE)
```

The function `separate_longer_position(col, width)` makes the input data frame longer through increased rows, with the string split up with specified widths.

###

Continuing in the same code cell, copy and paste our generated code. Then, try runninig our code in the console using `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter`! If needed, isolate the part with the relavant function, and only run the code up to that section with `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to see what the function changed.


### Exercise 17

Using the same AI, ask it to generate code that will combine two columns using `str_c()`, and then separate them again with `separate_wider_delim()`. CP/CR

```{r ai-usage-17}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 8)
```

###

Here is our generated code:

```
babynames %>%
       filter(str_starts(name, "A")) %>% 
       mutate(name_sex = str_c(name, sex, sep = "-")) %>% 
       separate_wider_delim(name_sex, delim = "-", names = c("name_clean", "sex_clean")) %>% 
       count(sex_clean, name_clean)
```

The function `separate_wider_delim(col, delim, names)` makes the input data frame wider through increased columns, with the string split up with a specified deliminator.

###

Continuing in the same code cell, copy and paste our generated code. Then, try runninig our code in the console using `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter`! If needed, isolate the part with the relavant function, and only run the code up to that section with `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to see what the function changed. For this one, run and print out the change after the first `mutate()`, and then run and print out what happens after the `separate_wider_delim()`.


### Exercise 18

Using the same AI, ask it to generate code that will combine two columns using `str_c()`, and then separate them again with `separate_wider_position()`. CP/CR.

```{r ai-usage-18}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 8)
```

###

Here is our generated code:

```
babynames %>% 
       filter(str_starts(name, "A")) %>% 
       mutate(name_sex = str_c(str_pad(name, width = 10, side = "right"), sex)) %>% 
       separate_wider_position(name_sex, positions = c(10), names = c("name_clean", "sex_clean")) %>% 
       select(name_clean, sex_clean)
```

The function `separate_wider_position(col, widths, names)` makes the input data frame wider through increased columns, with the string split up with a specified widths. Note how because the character length for names varied, we had to pad it with 10 extra characters so we could for sure separate the columns by width.

###

Continuing in the same code cell, copy and paste our generated code. Then, try runninig our code in the console using `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter`! If needed, isolate the part with the relavant function, and only run the code up to that section with `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to see what the function changed. For this one, run and print out the change after the first `mutate()`, and then run and print out what happens after the `separate_wider_position()`.


## String functions on **babynames**
###

In this section we are going to focus on generating code to manipulate our dataset called babynames. The `babynames` is a data set which contained names used for babies from 1880 to 2017. If you want to explore the data set, checkout [popular baby names](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). 

### Exercise 1

Make a new code cell, using AI, ask it to generate code that pipes **babynames** to `count()` with `str_length()` to find the distribution of lengths of US babynames. CP/CR.

```{r string-functions-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
``` 

###

Here's our code:

```
babynames %>%
  count(length = str_length(name), sort = TRUE)
```

The function `str_length()` tells you the number of letters in the string.

###

Copy and paste our generated code into the Console, and then run the code to get a new subset of data.


### Exercise 2

Next, get code that pipes **babynames** to `mutate()` and use `str_sub()` to find the first and last letter of each name. CP/CR.

```{r string-functions-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 5)
``` 

###

Here's our code:

```
babynames %>%
  mutate(
    first_letter = str_sub(name, 1, 1),
    last_letter = str_sub(name, -1, -1)
  ) %>%
  select(name, first_letter, last_letter)
```

The function `str_sub(string, start, end)` can extract parts of a string. The start and end are the positions where the substring should start and end, and the start and end arguments are inclusive.

###

Copy and paste our generated code into the Console, and then run the code to get a new subset of data.


### Exercise 3

Make a new code cell, using AI, get code that pipes **babynames** to `filter()` with name and `str_starts()` to find all names beginning with a certain string. CP/CR.

```{r string-functions-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
``` 

###

Here's our code:

```
babynames %>% filter(str_starts(name, "A"))
```

The function `str_starts()` returns TRUE if each string starts with the given pattern. We have used this function earlier in this tutorial!

###

Copy and paste our generated code into the Console, and then run the code to get a new subset of data.


### Exercise 4

Next, get code that pipes **babynames** to `filter()` with name and `str_ends()` to find all names ending with a certain string. CP/CR.

```{r string-functions-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
``` 

###

Here's our code:

```
babynames %>% filter(str_ends(name, "y"))
```

The function `str_ends()` returns TRUE if each string ends with the given pattern.

###

Copy and paste our generated code into the Console, and then run the code to get a new subset of data.


### Exercise 5

Next, get code that pipes **babynames** to `filter()` with name and `str_detect()` to find all names containing a certain string. CP/CR.

```{r string-functions-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
``` 

###

Here's our code:

```
babynames %>% filter(str_detect(name, "lex"))
```

The function `str_detect()` returns TRUE if each string contains the given pattern somewhere inside.

###

Copy and paste our generated code into the Console, and then run the code to get a new subset of data.


### Exercise 6

Next, get code that pipes **babynames** to `mutate()` with `str_to_lower()` and `str_to_upper()` to make new columns in the dataset that convert the string names to different cases. CP/CR.

```{r string-functions-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 5)
``` 

###

Here's our code:

```
babynames %>%
  mutate(lowercase = str_to_lower(name),
         uppercase = str_to_upper(name))
```

The functions `str_to_lower()` and `str_to_upper()` convert all characters in the string to their respective case.

###

Copy and paste our generated code into the Console, and then run the code to get a new subset of data.


### Exercise 7

Next, get code that pipes **babynames** to `mutate()` with `str_length()` and then `filter()` to get all names that are X letters long. CP/CR.

```{r string-functions-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 5)
``` 

###

Here's our code:

```
babynames %>%
  mutate(length = str_length(name)) %>%
  filter(length == 10)
```

The function `str_length()` returns the number of characters in each string.

###

Copy and paste our generated code into the Console, and then run the code to get a new subset of data.


### Exercise 8

Next, get code that pipes **babynames** to `mutate()` with `str_sub()` twice to obtain the first and last letter of each name. Run the code to get a new subset of data and print it out. CP/CR

```{r string-functions-8}
question_text(NULL,
    message = "Here's our code:\nbabynames %>%
  mutate(first_letter = str_sub(name, 1, 1),
         last_letter = str_sub(name, -1, -1))",          
    answer(NULL, 
           correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 5)
``` 

###

The function `str_sub()` extracts a substring from a string by position.


### Exercise 9

Next, get code that pipes **babynames** to `filter()` and detect all names with an "a", then pipe it to `mutate()` with `str_replace_all()` to create a new column that replaces all the "a"s with an "x". Run the code to get a new subset of data and print it out. CP/CR

```{r string-functions-9}
question_text(NULL,
    message = "Here's our code:\nbabynames %>%
  filter(str_detect(name, \"a\")) %>%
  mutate(modified = str_replace_all(name, \"ph\", \"f\"))",          
    answer(NULL, 
           correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 5)
``` 

###

The functions `str_replace()` and `str_replace_all()` replace the first match of a pattern in each string.


### Exercise 10

Next, get code that pipes **babynames** to `mutate()` with `str_count()` to make a new column that counts how many "a"s each name have. Run the code to get a new subset of data and print it out. CP/CR

```{r string-functions-10}
question_text(NULL,
    message = "Here's our code:\nbabynames %>%
  mutate(num_a = str_count(name, \"a\"))",          
    answer(NULL, 
           correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
``` 

###

The function `str_count()` counts the number of times a pattern appears in each string.


### Exercise 11

Next, get code that pipes **babynames** to `distinct()` and then to `mutate()` with `str_sort()` to changes the name column so that it orders the distinct names alphabetically. Run the code to get a new subset of data and print it out. CP/CR

```{r string-functions-11}
question_text(NULL,
    message = "Here's our code:\nbabynames %>%
  distinct(name) %>%
  mutate(name = str_sort(name, locale = \"en\", decreasing = FALSE))",          
    answer(NULL, 
           correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 5)
``` 

###

The function `str_sort()` sorts strings alphabetically, optionally by locale or in reverse. Locale refers to the language rules to follow for sorting.


### Exercise 12

Next, get code that pipes **babynames** to `mutate()` with `str_trim()` to create a new column with trimmed names. Run the code to get a new subset of data and print it out. CP/CR

```{r string-functions-12}
