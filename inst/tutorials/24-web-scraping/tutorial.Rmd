## Introduction
### 

This tutorial covers [Chapter 24: Web scraping](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/webscraping.html) from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. We will learn how to use the [**rvest**](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/), along with associated functions like `read_html()` and `html_table()` to download and organize data from the web.


## Web scaping basics
### 

Web scraping in R is a method of extracting data from websites using R programming language. It can be a valuable skill for students in data-related fields, allowing them to collect and analyze large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.

This section covers the basics of web scraping.

### Exercise 1

The key package for web scraping with R is [**rvest**](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/). Load the **rvest** library.

```{r web-scaping-basics-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r web-scaping-basics-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(rvest)
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-1-test, include = FALSE}
library(rvest)
```

### 

The "Web Scraping 101" [article](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/rvest.html) from the **rvest** [homepage](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) provides useful background. 

### Exercise 2

Look up the help page for the **rvest** package using the `help()` function. Don't forget to use the `package` argument.

```{r web-scaping-basics-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r web-scaping-basics-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
help(package = "...")
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-2-test, include = FALSE}
help(package = "rvest")
```

### 

The help page for a package provides a listing of all the functions in a package. Note that there are both `html_text()` and `html_text2()` functions. You should always use `html_text2()` unless you have a good reason not to.

### Exercise 3

Click on the link to the DESCRIPTION file which appeared when you looked up the help page for **rvest**. Copy the the first two lines (Package and Title) below.

```{r web-scaping-basics-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

As the DESCRIPTION file mentions, **rvest** is mostly supplying wrappers for the more lower level (but harder to use) **xml2** and **httr** packages. (As always, note how we, and everyone else uses the words "package" and "library" interchangeably.)

### Exercise 4

`minimal_html()` is an **rvest** function used for teaching. It turns text into an HTML document. Run `minimal_html()` with "test" as its first argument.

```{r web-scaping-basics-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r web-scaping-basics-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
minimal_html("test")
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-4-test, include = FALSE}
minimal_html("test")
```

### 

HTML stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage, the underlying text of the web. The main difference between HTML and plain text is the use of various "elements" and "attributes" which tell your browser how to display the text.

### Exercise 5

Assign the output of `minimal_html()` to an object called `html_1`. Then, on the next line, pass `html_1` as the argument to the `class()` function.


```{r web-scaping-basics-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-basics-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
html_1 <- minimal_html("test")
class(html_1)
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-5-test, include = FALSE}
class(html_1)
```

### 

HTML documents are an example from the broader class of XML objects. Recall that **rvest** is mostly a wrapper for the **xml2** package, which allows us to work with XML objects.

### Exercise 6

Use `minimal_html()` to create a more complex HTML document by running this code. Then, below this code, add `html_2` so that we can examine the object.


```{r web-scaping-basics-6, exercise = TRUE}
html_2 <- minimal_html("
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p id='first'>This is a paragraph</p>
  <p class='important'>This is an important paragraph</p>
")


```

```{r web-scaping-basics-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
html_2 <- minimal_html("
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p id='first'>This is a paragraph</p>
  <p class='important'>This is an important paragraph</p>
")

html_2
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-6-test, include = FALSE}
html_2
```

### 

Just typing/returning `html_2` produces the same result as `print(html_2)`. By design, the `print()` function should provide the key information about the object being printed. The first line tells us that `html_2` is an HTML document. The two listed elements ("head" and "body") are the two key parts of every HTML document. The "body" is the more important part since it contains all the information.

### Exercise 7

We have added `html_2` to your workspace so that you can use it to start pipes. Pipe `html_2` to `html_elements("p")`.

```{r web-scaping-basics-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r web-scaping-basics-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
html_2 |> 
  html_elements("...")
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-7-test, include = FALSE}
html_2 |> 
  html_elements("p")
```

### 

`html_elements()` pulls out all the elements that match the selector, which is provided to the `css` argument. "Elements" consist of a start tag (e.g. \<p\>), optional attributes (id='first'), an end tag4 (like \</p\>). The "contents" of an element are everything in between the start and end tag.

Since there are two elements with the "p" tag, where the "p" is for "paragraph," the result from `html_elements()` are those two elements. The element with the "h1" tag is not included.

### Exercise 8

Pipe `html_2` to `html_elements(".important")`. Note that the `css` argument is ".important" --- with a leading dot --- even though the attribute is "important" without a dot. 


```{r web-scaping-basics-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r web-scaping-basics-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
html_2 |> 
  html_elements(".important")
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-8-test, include = FALSE}
html_2 |> 
  html_elements(".important")
```

### 

When using `html_elements()` to select nodes on the basis of the class attribute rather than a tags we need a leading dot. Tags, on the other hand, are provided as is. Notice that the result of a call to `html_elements()` is an "xml_nodeset" rather than a full HTML document.

### Exercise 9

Pipe `html_2` to `html_elements("#first")`. Note that the `css` argument is "#first" --- with a leading hash mark --- even though the attribute, an id in this case, is "first" without a hash mark 

```{r web-scaping-basics-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r web-scaping-basics-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
html_2 |> 
  html_elements("...")
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-9-test, include = FALSE}
html_2 |> 
  html_elements("#first")
```

### 

Id attributes must be unique within a document, so this will only ever select a single element.

CSS is short for **c**ascading **s**tyle **s**heets, and is a tool for defining the visual styling of HTML documents. CSS includes a miniature language for selecting elements on a page called CSS selectors. CSS selectors define patterns for locating HTML elements, and are useful for scraping because they provide a concise way of describing which elements you want to extract.

### Exercise 10

Let's consider another piece of html. Run this code and then, below it, add `print(html_3)`.

```{r web-scaping-basics-10, exercise = TRUE}
html_3 <- minimal_html("
  <ul>
    <li><b>C-3PO</b> is a <i>droid</i> that weighs <span class='weight'>167 kg</span></li>
    <li><b>R2-D2</b> is a <i>droid</i> that weighs <span class='weight'>96 kg</span></li>
    <li><b>Yoda</b> weighs <span class='weight'>66 kg</span></li>
    <li><b>R4-P17</b> is a <i>droid</i></li>
  </ul>
  ")


```

```{r web-scaping-basics-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...

print(html_3)
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-10-test, include = FALSE}
print(html_3)
```

### 

Notice how the "body" portion of the html_document includes the raw html text, especially the nested list. The `<ul>` tag starts an **u**nordered **l**ist. The `<li>` tag starts an ordered **li**st.

### Exercise 11

Pipe `html_3` to `html_elements("li")` in order to make a vector where each element corresponds to a different character.

```{r web-scaping-basics-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r web-scaping-basics-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
html_3 |> 
  html_elements("..")
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-11-test, include = FALSE}
html_3 |> 
  html_elements("li")
```

### 

Thereâ€™s an important difference between `html_element()` and `html_elements()` when you use a selector that doesnâ€™t match any elements. `html_elements()` returns a vector of length 0, whereas `html_element()` returns a missing value. 

### Exercise 12

Continue the pipe to `html_element("b")`, which will pull out the elements from the list which are tagged with a "b", for **b**olded. Note that this is `html_element()`, not `html_elements()`. 

```{r web-scaping-basics-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-basics-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  html_element("b")
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-12-test, include = FALSE}
html_3 |> 
  html_elements("li")  |> 
  html_element("b")
```

### 

We are using clues in the HTML formatting --- bolding, in this case --- to determine a substantive issue, which are the names of the characters. Nothing guarantees that this two things are connected. They don't have to be! And, if the HTML document itself is sloppy or inconsistent, they won't be. 

You need to look closely at your results as you build your pipe, step-by-step.

### Exercise 13

Continue the pipe to `html_text2()`.

```{r web-scaping-basics-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-basics-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  html_text2()
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-13-test, include = FALSE}
html_3 |> 
  html_elements("li") |> 
  html_element("b") |> 
  html_text2()
```

### 

The last step of a web scrape is often `html_text2()`, since we (almost always) want to get rid of any weird formatting.


### Exercise 14

The last web scraping trick we cover involves how to handle html tables. HTML tables are built up from four main elements: `<table>`, `<tr>` (table row), `<th>` (table heading), and `<td>` (table data). 

Run this code to create a simple HTML table with two columns and three rows. Then, add `print(html_4)` to the end.

```{r web-scaping-basics-14, exercise = TRUE}
html_4 <- minimal_html("
  <table class='mytable'>
    <tr><th>x</th>   <th>y</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1.5</td> <td>2.7</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4.9</td> <td>1.3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>7.2</td> <td>8.1</td></tr>
  </table>
  ")


```

```{r web-scaping-basics-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...

print(html_4)
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-14-test, include = FALSE}
print(html_4)
```

### 

Note how the `<body>` section of the html_document begins with the `<table>` element. Also, note how the class of the table object is "mytable".

### Exercise 15

Pipe `html_4` to `html_element(".mytable")`


```{r web-scaping-basics-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r web-scaping-basics-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
html_4 |> 
  html_element("..")
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-15-test, include = FALSE}
html_4 |> 
  html_element(".mytable")
```

### 

We are using the fact that the object has class "mytable." Recall that, when accessing objects using their class, you must place a `.` in front of the name of the class.

### Exercise 16

Continue the pipe to `html_table()`.

```{r web-scaping-basics-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-basics-16-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  html_table()
```

```{r web-scaping-basics-16-test, include = FALSE}
html_4 |> 
  html_element(".mytable") |> 
  html_table()
```

### 

You won't always be lucky enough to have the data you want in a table, but, if you are, `html_table()` is magic.

With tools like  `html_element(s)()`, `html_text2()` and `html_table()`, you are ready to deal with HTML documents from the wild.



## Web scaping examples
### 

Consider two examples of material we might want to scrape. The [first](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html) is information about 7 Star Wars films from a vignette from the **rvest** package. The second involves the [250 highest rated films](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top) from IMDB. In this section, we will scrape and organize information from both.

If you do not have access to the internet while doing this tutorial, you can replace "https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html" with "data/star_wars.html" in all the questions below and everything should work.

### Exercise 1

Examine the [webpage](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html) for the Star Wars films. The URL is `https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html`. Pipe this URL to `read_html()`. (Be sure to surround the URL with quotation marks.)

```{r web-scaping-examples-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r web-scaping-examples-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
"https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html" |> 
  read_..()
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-1-test, include = FALSE}
"data/star_wars.html" |> 
  read_html()
```

Before we talk much about web scraping, we should talk about whether it is legal and ethical to do so. Overall, the situation is complicated. Legalities depend a lot on where you live. However, as a general rule of thumb, if the data is public, non-personal, and factual, you're most likely ok. These three factors connect to the siteâ€™s terms and conditions, personally identifiable information, and copyright, hence their importance.
If these factors are false, or you're scraping the web to make money, it's a good idea to talk to a lawyer, but in any case of web scraping, be respectful of the resources of the server hosting the page(s). This means that if you're scraping many pages, you should wait a bit in between each request.


 
### 

The structure of the underlying HTML looks like this:

````
<section>
  <h2 data-id="1">The Phantom Menace</h2>
  <p>Released: 1999-05-19</p>
  <p>Director: <span class="director">George Lucas</span></p>
  
  <div class="crawl">
    <p>...</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>...</p>
  </div>
</section>
````

### Exercise 2

Continue the pipe with `html_elements("section")`.

```{r web-scaping-examples-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  html_elements("..")

```

```{r web-scaping-examples-2-test, include = FALSE}
"data/star_wars.html" |> 
  read_html() |> 
  html_elements("section")
```

### 

We almost always begin scraping by creating an HTML document which can then be manipulated with functions like `html_elements()`. Note that `html_elements()` is not the same thing as `html_element()`, without the "s".

### Exercise 3

Continue the pipe with `html_element("h2")`. We want to pull out just the title of each movie. We can see that the titles are tagged with "h2".

```{r web-scaping-examples-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  html_element("h2")
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-3-test, include = FALSE}
"data/star_wars.html" |> 
  read_html() |> 
  html_elements("section") |> 
  html_element("h2")
```

### 

Note that we used `html_element()` in this example, as opposed to `html_elements()` (with the "s") last time. In this case, both functions produce the same answer.

### Exercise 4

Continue the pipe with `html_text2()`. We almost always want to clean up the underlying text before making use of it. Never use `html_text()` (without the "2") unless you have a good reason to.


```{r web-scaping-examples-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  html_...()
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-4-test, include = FALSE}
"data/star_wars.html" |> 
  read_html() |> 
  html_elements("section") |> 
  html_element("h2") |> 
  html_text2()
```

### 

`html_text2()` differs from `html_text()` slightly. while `html_text()` collapses all the text into a single string, `html_text2()` preserves the white space between elements, allowing you to retain the structure and formatting of the text as it appears on the web page.


### Exercise 5

Place the above chunk of code into the middle of a call to `tibble()` in which you are creating a tibble with one variable, `title`, which is the title of each movie. The resulting tibble should have one column and seven rows.


```{r web-scaping-examples-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...(title = 
         "https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html" |> 
         read_html() |> 
         html_elements("section") |> 
         html_elements("h2") |> 
         html_text2())
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-5-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(title = 
         "data/star_wars.html" |> 
         read_html() |> 
         html_elements("section") |> 
         html_elements("h2") |> 
         html_text2())

```

### 

A tibble is a data frame, but it tweaks some older behaviors to make life easier. R is an old language, and some features useful then now get in your way. The tibble package allows you to make data frames in a more streamlined and cleaner way compared to R's traditional data frames.

1) "https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html" 

2) ... |> 
    read_html() 
    
3) ... |> 
    html_elements("section")
    
4) Behind the scenes, we have created an object named `section` which is the result of this pipe. Type `section` in the exercise block and hit "Run Code."

<!-- DK: Turn the below into one or two proper questions. First question, pipe http to read. Second, continue pipe to html_elements(). Third, we report that, behind the scenes, we have assigned the result of this pipe to an object named "section." Then, we ask the question, "Type `section` and hit Run Code. -->

### Exercise 6


now we're going to learn how to streamline this process. Copy https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html" into the code box and hit `run code`

```{r web-scaping-examples-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
"https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html"
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-6-test, include = FALSE}
"https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html" 
```



What we're attempting to do here is rather than piping the web page every time we web scrape, we make an object to hold the results of the pipe, which we can call when needed.

### 

### Exercise 7

Pipe this to `read_html()`.

```{r web-scaping-examples-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
"https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html" |> 
         read_html() 
       
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-7-test, include = FALSE}
"https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html" |> 
         read_html() 
         
```


you can notice that the steps are currently similar right now, but there will be less steps needed to pull this off.


### 

### Exercise 8

Continue that pipe to `html_elements()` with "section" being its argument.

```{r web-scaping-examples-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
"https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html" |> 
         read_html() |> 
         html_elements(...)
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-8-test, include = FALSE}
 "https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html" |> 
         read_html() |> 
         html_elements("section")
```

### 

### Exercise 9

 Behind the scenes, we have created an object named `section` which is the result of this pipe. Type `section` in the exercise block and hit "Run Code."

```{r web-scaping-examples-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
section
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-9-test, include = FALSE}
section
```

### 

Creating an object like this is helpful when you need to web scrape the same page multiple times. It allows you to save on typing and makes the code easier to read and process.


### Exercise 10



Now that we have an object, we can use it for our tibble. Copy the code from above which created a tibble with one column, `title`. Change the code so that "https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html", is replaced with just `section`.

```{r web-scaping-examples-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}


       

tibble(title = s... |> 
         html_elements("h2") |> 
         html_text2())
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-10-test, include = FALSE}


tibble(title = section |> 
         html_elements("h2") |> 
         html_text2())

```

### 
we've now just created a tibble thats identical to the one above, but it was easier to write and will save time if we need to do so multiple times.

### Exercise 11

Consider [the highest rated movies](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top) on [IMDb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb), the Internet Movie Database. The URL is `https://web.archive.org/web/20200101054123/https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/`. Pipe that URL (with quotation marks) to `read_html()`.

```{r web-scaping-examples-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r web-scaping-examples-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
"https://web.archive.org/web/20200101054123/https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/" |> 
  ...
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-11-test, include = FALSE}
"data/imdb.html" |> 
  read_html()
```

### 

Note that `read_html()` takes longer to run than the previous example because the underlying webpage is much more complex.


### Exercise 12

The key element is a table, which is often the case with web scraping exercises. Continue the pipe to `html_element(".chart")`.


```{r web-scaping-examples-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  html_element("...")
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-12-test, include = FALSE}
"data/imdb.html" |>
  read_html() |> 
  html_element(".chart")
```

### 

The result is no longer an "html_document". Instead, it is an "html_node". 

<!-- Drop knowledge! Use of the "table" tag (?) and then use of html_table(). Two uses of "table" connected or random? -->
Data is normally stored in an HTML table, and its just a matter of reading it from that table. HTML tables are built up from four main elements: <table>, <tr> (table row), <th> (table heading), and <td> (table data). rvest provides us with a function to read this data: html:table(), which returns a list holding one tibble for each table found on the page. you can use html:element() to identify the table you want to extract.

### Exercise 13

Continue the pipe to `html_table()`.

```{r web-scaping-examples-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  html_table()
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-13-test, include = FALSE}
"data/imdb.html" |> 
  read_html() |> 
  html_element(".chart") |> 
  html_table()

#data/star_wars.html
```

### 

The result is a tibble with 250 rows and 5 columns. But, as you can see, the column names are a mess, as our the values in many of the cells. We need to clean it up.

### Exercise 14

Continue the pipe to a `select()` call which renames the second column to `rank_title_year ` and the third column to `rating`.

```{r web-scaping-examples-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  select(
      rank_title_year = `Rank & Title`,
      rating = `IMDb Rating`
    )
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-14-test, include = FALSE}
"data/imdb.html" |> 
  read_html() |> 
  html_element(".chart")|> 
  html_table() |> 
  select(rank_title_year = `Rank & Title`,
      rating = `IMDb Rating`)
```

### 

`select()` does two things: it keeps only two columns, both of which it renames. But the `rank_title_year` is a mess because it really includes three different variables, all mashed together.

### Exercise 15

Continue the pipe with a call to `mutate()` which runs `str_squish()` on `rank_title_year`, assigning the result to `rank_title_year`. Modifying a variable "in place" like this is a common approach. We don't need to keep the original value around. 


```{r web-scaping-examples-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  mutate(
    rank_title_year = str_squish(rank_title_year)
  )
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-15-test, include = FALSE}
"data/imdb.html" |> 
  read_html() |> 
  html_element(".chart") |> 
  html_table() |> 
  select(rank_title_year = `Rank & Title`,
      rating = `IMDb Rating`) |> 
  mutate( rank_title_year = str_squish(rank_title_year))
```

### 

[`str_squish()`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_trim.html) removes whitespace at the start and end or a character variable, and replaces all internal whitespace with a single space.

### Exercise 16

Continue the call to `mutate()`, creating a new variable called `rank` which is the result of running `parse_number()` on `rank_title_year`.

```{r web-scaping-examples-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-16-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  mutate(rank = parse_number(rank_title_year))
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-16-test, include = FALSE}
"data/imdb.html" |> 
  read_html() |> 
  html_element(".chart") |> 
  html_table() |> 
  select(rank_title_year = `Rank & Title`,rating = `IMDb Rating`) |> 
  mutate(rank_title_year = str_squish(rank_title_year)) |> 
  mutate(rank = parse_number(rank_title_year))
```

### 

This approach depends on the fact that [`parse_number()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/parse_number.html) grabs the first number it can find in the string. It ignores characters and numbers which come after.

<!-- AC: Not sure why we need multiple calls to mutate? We could just put it all in one? -->

### Exercise 17

Continue the pipe to `mutate()`, creating a new variable `title` which is the result of running `str_extract()` on `rank_title_year` with the pattern argument set to `"(?<=\\d\\.\\s)(.*)(?=\\s\\(\\d{4}\\))"`.

```{r web-scaping-examples-17, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-17-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  mutate(title = str_extract(rank_title_year, 
                             pattern = "(?<=\\d\\.\\s)(.*)(?=\\s\\(\\d{4}\\))"))
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-17-test, include = FALSE}
"data/imdb.html" |> 
  read_html() |> 
  html_element(".chart") |> 
  html_table() |> 
  select(rank_title_year = `Rank & Title`,rating = `IMDb Rating`) |> 
  mutate( rank_title_year = str_squish(rank_title_year)) |> 
  mutate(rank = parse_number(rank_title_year)) |> 
  mutate(title = str_extract(rank_title_year, 
                             pattern = "(?<=\\d\\.\\s)(.*)(?=\\s\\(\\d{4}\\))"))
```

### 

We gave [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) this prompt:

> Using the stringr package in R, I want to run str_extract() on the string "1. The Shawshank Redemption (1994)" and extract just "The Shawshank Redemption". What pattern should I use?

It gave back the regular expression above, explaining:

> This will extract the substring between the digit and dot followed by a space, and the year in parentheses. The (`?<=`) and (`?=`) are positive lookbehind and lookahead assertions respectively, which match the pattern inside them but do not include it in the final output. The `.*` matches any characters in between.

Use AI to solve any regular expression problem that takes longer than 30 seconds.

### Exercise 18

Complete the pipe with a `select()` statement which keeps `rank`, `title` and `rating` in that order.

```{r web-scaping-examples-18, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r web-scaping-examples-18-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
"data/imdb.html"  |> 
  read_html() |> 
  html_element(".chart") |> 
  html_table() |>   
  select(
    rank_title_year = `Rank & Title`,
    rating = `IMDb Rating`
) |> 
  mutate(
    rank_title_year = str_squish(rank_title_year)
) |> 
  mutate(rank = parse_number(rank_title_year)) |>   
  mutate(title = 
           str_extract(rank_title_year, 
                       pattern = "(?<=\\d\\.\\s)(.*)(?=\\s\\(\\d{4}\\))")) |> 
  select(rank, title, rating)
```

```{r web-scaping-examples-18-test, include = FALSE}
"data/imdb.html"  |> 
  read_html() |> 
  html_element(".chart") |> 
  html_table() |>   
  select( rank_title_year = `Rank & Title`, rating = `IMDb Rating`) |> 
  mutate(rank_title_year = str_squish(rank_title_year)) |> 
  mutate(rank = parse_number(rank_title_year)) |>   
  mutate(title = str_extract(rank_title_year,  pattern = "(?<=\\d\\.\\s)(.*)(?=\\s\\(\\d{4}\\))")) |> 
  select(rank, title, rating)
```
