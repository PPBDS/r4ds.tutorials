## Introduction
###

This tutorial covers [Chapter 19: Missing Values](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/missing-values.html) from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. The primary focus of this tutorial will be to teach you how to use commands like [`fill()`] to fill in missing values, [`coalesce()`] to replace missing values with another value, and [`na_if()`] to replace certain values with a missing value, [`NA`]. Additionally we will look at functions like [`complete()`] which lets you generate missing values from a set of variables, and how to use [`anti_join()`] for missing values when joining data sets.


## Explicit Missing Values
###

### Exercise 1

Load the **tidyverse** package with the `library()` command.

```{r explicit-missing-val-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r explicit-missing-val-1-hint, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

###

The functions for working with missing data mostly come from dplyr and tidyr, which are core members of the tidyverse.

### Exercise 2

Run this code in order to create a tibble called `treatment`.

```{r explicit-missing-val-2, exercise = TRUE}
treatment <- tribble(
  ~person,           ~treatment, ~response,
  "Derrick Whitmore", 1,         7,
  NA,                 2,         10,
  NA,                 3,         NA,
  "Katherine Burke",  1,         4
)
```

###

A common use for missing values is as a data entry convenience. When data is entered by hand, missing values sometimes indicate that the value in the previous row has been repeated (or carried forward).

### Exercise 3

Write `treatment` and hit "Run Code".

```{r explicit-missing-val-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r explicit-missing-val-3-hint, eval = FALSE}
treatment
```

###

Use `glimpse()` or `View()` for alternative ways to view the data.

### Exercise 4

Pipe `treatment` to `fill()` with the argument `response`.

```{r explicit-missing-val-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r explicit-missing-val-4-hint, eval = FALSE}
treatment |>
  ...(response)
```

###

This treatment is sometimes called “last observation carried forward”, or locf for short.

### Exercise 5

Use the same code, but replace `response` with `everything()`. Recall that `everything()` is a function which returns all the variables in a tibble.

```{r explicit-missing-val-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r explicit-missing-val-5-hint, eval = FALSE}
treatment |>
  fill(...)
```

###

You can use the `.direction` argument to fill in missing values that have been generated in more exotic ways.

### Exercise 6

Create a variable `x` and assign it to the vector `c(1, 4, 5, 7, NA)`.

```{r explicit-misisng-values-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r explicit-missing-values-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 4, 5, 7, NA)
```

### Exercise 7

Many times we will see missing values that actually represent some fixed known value, most commonly 0. 

Use `coalesce()`  from `dplyr` with `x` and `0` as arguments to replace the missing values with `0`

```{r explicit-misisng-values-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r explicit-missing-values-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 4, 5, 7, NA)
coalesce(x,...)
```

###

As we can see, the `NA` value turned into a `0`.

### Exercise 8

Create a variable `x` and assign it to the vector `c(1, 4, 5, 7, -99)`.

```{r explicit-misisng-values-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r explicit-missing-values-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
x <- c(..., ..., ..., ..., ...)
```

###

At times we will see the opposite issue where some fixed known value actually represents a missing value. 

### Exercise 9

Use `na_if()` from the `dplyr` package and use `x` and `-99` to replace the `-99` with a missing value.

```{r explicit-misisng-values-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r explicit-missing-values-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 4, 5, 7, -99)
na_if(x, ...)
```

###

This usually happens when data is generated by some older software that is forced to use a value like `99` or `-999` as a missing value.

### 

Before we continue, there’s one special type of missing value that you’ll encounter from time to time: a `NaN` (pronounced “nan”), or not a number.

### Exercise 10

Assign x to a vector `c(NA, NaN)`.

```{r explicit-missing-val-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r explicit-missing-val-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
x <- c(..., ...)
```

###

In the rare case you need to distinguish an `NA` from a `NaN`, you can use `is.nan(x)`.

### Exercise 11

Copy the code from the previous exercise and use the `is.nan()` command with `x` as its argument.

```{r explicit-missing-val-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r explicit-missing-val-11-hint, eval = FALSE}
...(x)
```

###

You’ll generally encounter a NaN when you perform a mathematical operation that has an indeterminate result.

### Exercise 12

Run `0/0`, `0*Inf`, `Inf - Inf`, and `sqrt(-1)`

```{r explicit-missing-val-12, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r explicit-missing-val-12-hint, eval = FALSE}

0/0
0*Inf
Inf-Inf
sqrt(-1)
```

###

All of these are mathematical operations that have indeterminate results and thus return `NaN`.
