## Introduction
### 

This tutorial covers material from [Chapter 28 Quarto](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) and [Chapter 29 Quarto formats](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto-formats.html) in [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, although much of the information from Chapter 28 has already appeared in the "RStudio and GitHub" tutorials in this package. You will practice again the process of creating [Quarto websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) but at a quicker pace. You will learn some new skills, such as how to add visualization, text to your website and new pages. You will also learn how to save your data-manipulation code in an RDS file and how to save your plots as PNG files.

## Website 1
### 

Let's create and publish a [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) as we previously did.

### Exercise 1

Create a public GitHub repo (called "website-1"). Make sure to click the "Add a README file" check box. Copy/paste the URL for its GitHub location.

```{r website-1-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like:

```
https://github.com/davidkane9/website-1
```

Always start a new data science project with a new GitHub repo.


### Exercise 2

Connect the `website-1` GitHub repo to an R project on your computer. Name the R project `website-1` also. Keeping the names of repos/projects aligned makes organization simpler.

Remember to "Terminate Jobs" this tutorial. 

From the Terminal, run `ls`. CP/CR.

```{r website-1-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like this:

```
Davids-MBP:website-1 dkane$ ls
README.md               website-1.Rproj
Davids-MBP:website-1 dkane$ 
```

### Exercise 3

In the Terminal, run `quarto create project website .`.  Don't forget the `.` at the end of the command.

Depending on your computer setup, this command will require you to answer some questions. Do so as best you can. When asked what to open the website with choose "rstudio".

This command will usually result in a restart of your RStudio instance. Or it might create a second R instance, also located in the `website-1` directory. If so, close one of the instances. It does not matter which.

CP/CR.

```{r website-1-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
Davids-MacBook-Pro:website-1 dkane$ quarto create project website .
Creating project at /Users/dkane/Desktop/projects/website-1:
  - Created _quarto.yml
  - Created .gitignore
  - Created index.qmd
  - Created about.qmd
  - Created styles.css
Davids-MacBook-Pro:website-1 dkane$ 
````

Quarto is telling you what it did: creating 5 new files and placing them in the *current* directory. Recall that, on the command line, a `.` refers to the current directory. 

### Exercise 4

In the Console, run `list.files()`. CP/CR.

```{r website-1-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> list.files()
[1] "_quarto.yml"         "about.qmd"           "website-1.Rproj" "index.qmd"          
[5] "README.md"           "styles.css"         
````

The basic set of files necessary for making a Quarto website has been added to the current directory. Note how we can work with the current directory either from the Terminal, with commands like `ls`, or from the Console, with commands like `list.files()`. It is important for you to be comfortable with both approaches, so we intermix them in this tutorial.

### Exercise 5

In the Console, run:

````
library(tutorial.helpers)
show_file("_quarto.yml")
````

CP/CR.

```{r website-1-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 10)
```

### 

The `_quarto.yml` controls the creation of the project, in this case a website.

### Exercise 6

In the Source pane, open the `_quarto.yml` file. Change the title to `"Website 1"`. Save the file. The indentation before `title` should match that of `navbar` directly below it.

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("_quarto.yml", start = 4, end = 10)
````

CP/CR.


```{r website-1-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Quarto offers a wide range of output formats. You can find the complete list at https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html. Many formats share some output options (e.g., `toc: true` for including a table of contents), but others have options that are format specific (e.g., `code-fold: true` collapses code chunks into a `<details>` tag for HTML output so the user can display it on demand, it’s not applicable in a PDF or Word document).

### Exercise 7

Open the `index.qmd` file in the Source pane. Replace the title with `"Homepage"`. Save the file.

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd")
````

CP/CR.


```{r website-1-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Note that the `title` (`"Website 1"`) in `_quarto.yml` has no necessary connection to the `title` (`"Homepage"`) in `index.qmd`. The former is the title for the entire website. The latter is the title for just the (yet-to-be-created) `index.html` page.

### Exercise 8

Add this line to the `.gitignore` file:

* `*Rproj`

Ensure that there is a blank line at the bottom of the file. Click Save. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file(".gitignore")
````

CP/CR.

```{r website-1-8}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 6)
```

### 

`*Rproj` removes the `website-1.Rproj` file from the purview of GitHub because, in general, we don't put "settings" files on GitHub.


### Exercise 9

Commit and push all the files in the project. Run `git log` in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r website-1-9}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

The output from the `git log` command is too complex for us to fully parse. If you want to learn more about how to work with Git/GitHub and R, check out [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html), a very useful resource.


### Exercise 10

From the Terminal, run `quarto render`. CP/CR.

```{r website-1-10}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like:

````
Davids-MBP:website-1 dkane$ quarto render
[1/2] index.qmd
[2/2] about.qmd

Output created: _site/index.html

Davids-MBP:website-1 dkane$ 
````

### Exercise 11

From the Console, run `list.files("_site")`. CP/CR.


```{r website-1-11}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer will probably look something like:

````
> list.files("_site")
[1] "about.html"  "index.html"  "search.json" "site_libs"   "styles.css" 
>
````

### Exercise 12

Add `/_site` to the `.gitignore`. Don't forget that the last line of a `.gitignore` should always be blank. Save the file. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file(".gitignore")
````

CP/CR.

```{r website-1-12}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The initial backslash in `/_site` allows Git to interpret `_site` correctly. The `/` escapes the `_`, allowing it to be treated as a literal, rather than special, character. See the "Regular expressions" tutorial in this package for more information. `_site` is a directory, so we could end the expression with a backslash, but Git, like most programs interpret `_site` and `_site/` to refer to the same thing, which they do.

### Exercise 13

From the Terminal, run `quarto preview`. CP/CR.

```{r website-1-13}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like this:

````
Davids-MBP:website-1 dkane$ quarto preview
Preparing to preview
[1/1] index.qmd

Watching files for changes
Browse at http://localhost:7412/
GET: /
````

The `quarto preview` command does two things. First, it renders the  files, just like `quarto render` does. Second, it sets up a viewer --- probably your default web browser but possibly the "Viewer" tab in the Output pane  --- so that you can see what the website looks like. Click around and check it out!

The message at the end indicates that Quarto is now "watching" your files to see if you make any changes. If you do, it will automatically update the website.

### Exercise 14

Ensure that all the files in the project have been committed and pushed. 

At the Terminal, type: 

`quarto publish gh-pages` 

Copy/paste the URL for your website. 

```{r website-1-14}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 10)
```

### 

You can also use Quarto to produce presentations. You get less visual control than with a tool like Keynote or PowerPoint, but automatically inserting the results of your R code into a presentation can save a huge amount of time. Presentations work by dividing your content into slides, with a new slide beginning at each second (`##`) level header. Additionally, first (`#`) level headers indicate the beginning of a new section with a section title slide that is, by default, centered in the middle.

### Exercise 15

Commit and push all the files in the project. Run `git log -n 2` in the Terminal. CP/CR. 

The `-n 2` option causes Git to just provide the information on the last two commits.

```{r website-1-15}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

We recommend that you use an RStudio project for your websites and books. Based on the `_quarto.yml` file, RStudio will recognize the type of project you’re working on, and add a Build tab to the IDE that you can use to render and preview your websites and books. Both websites and books can also be rendered using `quarto::quarto_render()`.

## Website 2
### 

Let's create a new website with following plot on its home page.

```{r}
diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(title = "Prices and Sizes for Diamonds of Color D",
         subtitle = "'Round' carat values like 1, 1.5 and 2 are more common.",
         x = "Carat",
         y = "Price")
```

### Exercise 1

Create a public GitHub repo (called "website-2"). Make sure to click the "Add a README file" check box.

Connect the `website-2` GitHub repo to an R project on your computer. Name the R project `website-2` also. 

Remember to "Terminate Jobs" this tutorial, if asked. You can always restart it afterwards. 

From the Terminal, run `ls`. CP/CR.

```{r website-2-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Recall that the `index.qmd` file will always create our "home" page because it is rendered to `index.html`. Browsers, by default, show `index.html`, if one exists, when they visit a new directory. 

### Exercise 2

In the Terminal, run `quarto create project website .`.  

From the Console, run `usethis::use_github_pages()`.

In the Terminal, run `ls -a`.

CP/CR.

```{r website-2-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The `.` in the `quarto create` command refers to the current working directory. That is, we are telling Quarto to put all the necessary files right here.

We are moving faster in the creation of Website 2 than we did when making Website 1 because you should already be familar with the steps. We will go even faster when we make Website 3.


### Exercise 3

Add `*Rproj` and `\_site` to the `.gitignore` files. Save it.


In the Console, run:

````
show_file(".gitignore")
````

CP/CR.

```{r website-2-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Keeping track of all the different files and understanding how they work together is a central skill in creating larger projects.


### Exercise 4

Delete everything in `index.qmd` except for the `title`, which should be changed to `"My Cool Plot"`, surrounded by the three dashes, above and below. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd")
````

CP/CR.

(Did you remember to `library(tutorial.helpers)` first? Without this, R can't find he `show_file()` command.)

```{r website-2-4}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

The material bracketed by the three dashes at the very top is called a **YAML Header**. These files are very sensitive about all sorts of subtle formatting issues. 


### Exercise 5

Create a new code chunk in `index.qmd` and load the **tidyverse** package. Save the file.

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd", chunk = "Last")
````

CP/CR.

```{r website-2-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

There are three ways to do most things associated with project/website creation.

First, we can use RStudio. This is our preferred approach, since it is the easiest for beginning students. Unfortunately, the RStudio interface is somewhat behind in using Quarto effectively.

Second, we can use an R package like **quarto** directly. RStudio buttons are, generally, connected to R package commands. 

Third, we can work with Quarto directly at the Terminal. This is often referred to as *working from the command line*. R packages often call Terminal commands behind the scenes. [Current limitations](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-r/issues/101#issuecomment-2093088356) of the **quarto** package force us to use this option.


### Exercise 6

From the Terminal, run `quarto preview`. 

Copy and paste the home page, leaving out the menu items.

```{r website-2-6}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 10)
```

### 

You answer should look like this:

````
My Cool Plot
library(tidyverse)

── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5
✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1
✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1
✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0
✔ purrr     1.0.2     
── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
ℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors
````

Because we have not yet added any code chunk options, the code is echoed and the package startup message displayed.


### Exercise 7

Create another code chunk. Add this code to it:

````
diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(title = "Prices and Sizes for Diamonds of Color D",
         subtitle = "'Round' carat values like 1, 1.5 and 2 are more common.",
         x = "Carat",
         y = "Price")
````

Save the file. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd", chunk = "Last")
````

CP/CR.

```{r website-2-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Instead of running `quarto preview` from the Terminal, we can also simply render the `index.qmd` page by using:

`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K`. 

This does the same thing as hitting the "Render" button.

You will see a nice plot, along with a lot of junk code and messages. Note that RStudio might only redirect you to the plot the first time you render `index.qmd`. Going forward, you may need to affirmatively click on the correct tab on your browser or on the Viewer tab in the Output pane to see the newly rendered page.


### Exercise 8

Add these code chunk options to the top of the first code chunk, the one which loads the library.

<!-- DK: These reason these aren't in a four backticks area is because format_tutorial() would, for unknown reasons, add a space between # and | if we did that, and such a space makes these no longer function as chunk options when pastes into the students' index.qmd. Without the blanks lines, these are all placed in the same paragraph. -->

`#| message: false`

`#| echo: false`

`#| label: setup`

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd", pattern = "#")
````

CP/CR.

```{r website-2-8}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Code that works during your R session will not work when your website is rendered if you have not loaded the required libraries into the document. But our readers don't want to see that code, much less the messages which it produces. So, we hide them.

You are generally free to label your chunks however you like, but there is one chunk name that imbues special behavior in RStudio: `setup`. When you first open a Quarto document, the chunk named `setup`, if there is one, will be run automatically once, before any other code is run.


### Exercise 9

In the second code chunk, add the following options:

<!-- DK: See above comment. Really need to fix format_tutorial so that, first step, it totally ignores anything within four backticks. But, I suspect the real problem is in parsermd. -->

`#| echo: false`

`#| label: diamonds-plot`

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd", pattern = "#")
````

CP/CR.

```{r website-2-9}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Assigning labels to code chunks helps keeps you organized and helps others understand your code. You cannot assign the same label to multiple code chunks. 

Your chunk labels should be short but evocative and should not contain spaces. We recommend using dashes (`-`) to separate words (instead of underscores, `_`) and avoiding other special characters in chunk labels.

### Exercise 10

Render the `index.qmd` with the "Render" button. It should show the plot. As always, you could render with `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K`. Shortcut keys are lit!

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd")
````

CP/CR.

```{r website-2-10}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 12)
```

### 

There are two common modes for working with larger projects. First, as here, we work with an individual file, like `index.qmd`, and ensure that it is working as we want. Second, as before, we work with the project as a whole, using commands like `quarto render`, which render all the files in the project. The former approach is quickest and is how we spend most of our time. But, at the end of the day, we need to build the entire project.

### Exercise 11

It is annoying to use the same code chunk option in every code chunk. In `index.qmd`, both code chunks contain `#| echo: false`. Delete both of them. Edit the YAML header so that it includes:

````
execute: 
  echo: false
````

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd", end = 5)
````

CP/CR.

```{r website-2-11}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> show_file("index.qmd", end = 5)
---
title: "Website 2"
execute: 
  echo: false
---
````

If you added `echo: false` as an `execute` argument in `_quarto.yml`, this would affect all the QMD files in the entire project. In other words, you can set an option like `echo` in three places: individual code chunk, entire QMD file, or entire project. Options set at higher levels can be overruled by changing the setting at a lower level.


### Exercise 12

Go to the Git tab. Commit and push your new changes to GitHub. Include a descriptive commit message, e.g. "Added plot to home page".

In the Terminal, run `quarto publish gh-pages`. You may need to hit "enter/return" once.

Copy/paste the URL below:

```{r website-2-12}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this, but with your user name instead of mine.

````
https://davidkane9.github.io/website-2/
````

Keep track of the three different versions of the website. 

First, we have the QMD files in the project directory which are used to create the website. This is the original source, the place where changes should be made. 

Second, we have the rendered version of the files which reside in the `_site` directory on our computer. We do not edit these files directly, but we do look at them when we are "previewing" the website.

Third, we have the website itself, the files which other people can see. These reside on GitHub, in this case, but we could put them on a different hosting service.


## Adding text
### 

Quarto allows for a combination of plain text and R code. This same feature allows you to add plain text to your website.

### Exercise 1

Open `about.qmd `. Delete all the current text, except for the YAML header. Ensure that the `title` is `"About"`. Add `## About Me` as the first (and only) line of text. Render the QMD. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("about.qmd")
````

CP/CR.


```{r adding-text-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Hash signs in front of text makes the text into a header. The organization of headers is determined by the number of hash signs. Fewer hash signs make higher level headers, i.e. bigger text. More hash signs make lower level headers, i.e. smaller text. 

### 

Keep in mind that your browser now has two tabs which show your website. First, the GitHub Pages version, which has not changed since you last hit `quarto publish`. The only way to affect the public website is to publish to it. Second, the `localhost` version, which is what you have been changing every time that you render `index.qmd`.

### Exercise 2

Write a one sentence description of yourself. Write it below the header. Include your name and school, either the one you attend or one from which you have graduated. Write until the end of the line, i.e. do not use the `Enter` key to wrap text. When you are finished, render the QMD. Example:

````
My name is David Kane, and I graduated from Williams College.
````

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("about.qmd")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-text-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

You can have a Quarto document without a YAML header, if you like. You can also have an empty YAML header. But, it will often be the case that we want all the files in a project to have similar YAML headers in order to create a consistent look-and-feel.


### Exercise 3

Let's bold your name and italicize your school's name. In the description you have already written, surround your name with two asterisks, `**`, on both sides. Let's also put a single asterisk, `*`, around both sides of your school. Example:

````
My name is **David Kane**, and I graduated from *Williams College*.
````

`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K`

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("about.qmd")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-text-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 6)
```

### 

Quarto, which is based on the Markdown language, has a variety of [formatting options](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

Examples of Quarto formatting options incclude:

````
**bold** *italic* ~~strikeout~~ `code`

superscript^2^ subscript~2~

[underline]{.underline} [small caps]{.smallcaps}
````

<!-- Can we make the format of the above look like the below? Like put them both in boxes? Right now, only the raw text is in a box, because of the four backticks. -->

These look like:

**bold** *italic* ~~strikeout~~ `code`

superscript^2^ subscript~2~

[underline]{.underline} [small caps]{.smallcaps}


### Exercise 4

At the bottom of `about.qmd`, let's create text which is also a hyperlink to a website. Enclose the text "Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp" in brackets `[]`. Then, without a space intervening, add parentheses `()` which enclose a link to the relevant website: `https://bootcamp.davidkane.info`.

It should look like:

````
[Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info)
````

`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K`. (Recall that rendering automatically saves the file first.)

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("about.qmd", pattern = "Kane")
````

CP/CR.


```{r adding-text-4}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

You only need a few [formatting tricks](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) for working with Quarto files, but you will use those tricks repeatedly.


### Exercise 5

Push all the changes to Git, and issue the `quarto publish gh-pages` command in the Terminal. You need to hit "Enter" at least once. CP/CR.

```{r adding-text-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Troubleshooting Quarto documents can be challenging because you are no longer in an interactive R environment, and you will need to learn some new tricks. Additionally, the error could be due to issues with the Quarto document itself or due to the R code in the Quarto document.

If the errors are due to the R code in the document, the first thing you should always try is to recreate the problem in an interactive session. Render the QMD. If you’re lucky, that will recreate the problem, and you can figure out what’s going on interactively.

## Adding new pages
### 

Here you will learn how to create new pages for your website, accessible via the navigation bar at the top.

### Exercise 1

Go to `File -> New File -> Quarto Document...`. Title it "Sources". Select "Create Empty Document" (in the bottom left corner). Save the file, changing the file name from `Untitled.qmd` to `sources.qmd`. 

### 

In the Terminal, run `ls *qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

You should see `index.qmd`, `about.qmd`, and `sources.qmd` in the output. If not, make sure you are in the `website-1` directory. The `*qmd` regular expression selects only files with names which end with the letters `qmd`.

### Exercise 2

In the `sources.qmd` file, below the YAML header, add the text `An overview of sources used in my project.` Save the file.

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("sources.qmd", pattern = "overview")
````

CP/CR.


```{r adding-new-pages-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Note how newly created Quarto documents like `sources.qmd` differ from that we have previously created in two ways. First, they do not have a `format: html` YAML line in the header. Second, they feature different default text. 

This is an RStudio feature. It knows that this directory is a website project and that, therefore, it is unnecessary to even mention the format, which is best controlled from `_quarto.yml`. 


### Exercise 3

Add the following sentence: 

````
These are my sources. Here are some challenges. Quarto websites are awesome.
````

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("sources.qmd")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

A website, when you first look closely, may appear overwhelming in its complexity. But it is usually created from of a simple collection of text files, each of them quite simple.

You may be directed to the `localhost` version of your website, showing the "Sources" page. You have rendered the QMD into HTML. But notice that there is no way to get to this page via the website menu . . . 

### Exercise 4

Open the `_quarto.yml` file. You should see a line that says `navbar`. Below this line you should see the line `left`. Below this is the code that creates the header links for the navigation bar on your site. It should look like:

```
website:
  title: "Website 2"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
```
    

### 

To add `sources.qmd` as a new page which will appear on the menu, we need to edit this as follows:

```
website:
  title: "Website 2"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
      - href: sources.qmd
        text: Sources
```

Note the two additional lines. 

The `href` line tells Quarto to create an HTML page by rendering `sources.qmd` and to include that new page in the website. 

The `text` line tells Quarto to format the link in the **nav**igation tool**bar** as `Sources`. This is the same process by which the home page, created from `index.qmd`, has a link labeled `Home`.

Since `- about.qmd` appears without either the `href` or `text` argument, Quarto assumes that you want the link to be the same as the title of the QMD. 

<!-- Is this true? Explain this better. -->

### 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("_quarto.yml")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-4}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 8)
```

### 

**YAML files are *very* tricky!** Tabs and white spaces matter. The code `left` before the navbar items puts the navigation bar on the left side of your site. This can be changed to `right``.


### Exercise 5

Run `quarto preview` from the Terminal. You will need to hit "Enter" once. Check out your new project! See how "Sources" now appears on the navigation toolbar. Click on "Sources" and see how the text you added to `sources.qmd` now appears on the web.

Run `ls _site/*html` in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-5}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

You should see several HTML pages, including `sources.html`. Quarto websites, like many similar frameworks, place all the pages which appear on the web into a single directory, like `_site`, and then move that directory onto a hosting service like GitHub Pages.


### Exercise 6

In the `_quarto.yml` file, delete the two lines of code that create the link and header for the "Sources" page.

In the Terminal, stop the preview by hitting the stop sign button. Then, use `rm` to remove `sources.qmd`. Run `ls *qmd` in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-6}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

There should not be a `sources.qmd` file. We are practicing these skills to make you more comfortable building up and tearing down the parts of a project. You need to build more than one house to get good at house-building!

### Exercise 7

Make two more empty Quarto documents, in the same way as you did above, with titles `"Source 1"` and `"Source 2"`.  

You should save them both (so they're not `untitled1` and `untitled2`). Name them `source-1.qmd` and `source-2.qmd`. 

In the Terminal, run the command `head source-1.qmd source-2.qmd`. CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-7}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

In many Terminal commands, you can provide more than one file as the target of the command. In this case, `head` will be applied to `source-1.qmd` and then `source-2.qmd` sequentially.


### Exercise 8

Let's create a drop-down menu called "Sources" through which one could visit either the page for "Source 1" or "Source 2" from the top menu.

We will be messing around with YAML settings to make this, so pay very close attention

The Quarto [documentation](https://quarto.org/) provides an [excellent overview](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html) of approaches to website navigation. 

Change `_quarto.yml` so that the `navbar` section looks like this


````
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - text: Sources
        menu:
          - href: source-1.qmd
            text: Source 1
          - href: source-2.qmd
            text: Source 2 
      - about.qmd
````        

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("_quarto.yml")
````

CP/CR.

```{r adding-new-pages-8}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 10)
```

### 

Run `quarto preview` to see the changes. 


### Exercise 9

Go to the Git tab, then commit and push your new changes to GitHub. Include a descriptive commit message, e.g. "Added source pages".

From the Terminal, run `git log -n 1`. CP/CR. 

(You will probably need to stop the preview. But, if you want to be tricky, you can start a new Terminal by clicking on the small triangle next to the Terminal triangle --- below the Terminal tab in the Console pane --- and selecting "New Terminal".)

```{r adding-new-pages-9}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Type `quarto publish` in the Terminal and hit "Enter." Explore the use of the "Sources" menu on your website.


## Website 3
### 

Let's make one more website using the same repo/project/quarto approach as above. We will also learn about storing R objects in RDS files.

### Exercise 1

Create a public GitHub repo (called "website-3"). Make sure to click the "Add a README file" check box.

Connect the `website-3` GitHub repo to an R project on your computer. Name the R project `website-3` also. 

In the Terminal, run `quarto create project website .`.  

From the Console, run `usethis::use_github_pages()`.

In the Terminal, run `ls -a`.

CP/CR.

```{r website-3-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

This is the fourth time you have created a Github Pages website in the two Quarto Websites tutorials in this package.

### Exercise 2

Add `*Rproj` and `\_site` to the `.gitignore` files. 

Edit the `_quarto.yml` file to set the `title` to `"My Website"`.

Edit the `index.qmd` file so that only the `title` remains. Set the `title` equal to `"My Home Page"`.

Save all files. Commit and push everything. From the Terminal, run `git log`. CP/CR.


```{r website-3-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Again, the `title` in `_quarto.yml` determines the title of the entire website. The `title` at the top of `index.qmd` specifies the title of just that page.

### Exercise 3

From the Terminal, run `quarto preview` to examine the website. You should see the titles that you have specified. If you don't, fix things.

From the Terminal, run `quarto publish gh-pages` to publish the website.

Copy/paste the URL for your website.


```{r website-3-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Behind the scenes, `usethis::use_github_pages()` has created a second [*branch*](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) for your repo, named `gh-pages`. "Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line." 

The details of branching are beyond the scope of this package.

### Exercise 4

Delete all the text in `index.qmd`. Replace it with (mostly) the same text as from Website 2.

```{r file = "images/full_index.txt", echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```

From the Console, run

````
show_file("index.qmd",  end = 5)
````

CP/CR.

```{r website-3-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

One problem with this approach is that all this code is run every time someone refreshes the homepage. That is wasteful, especially if the code takes a while to run. 

## Using an RDS file
### 

An RDS file allows us to save any R object in a file. When we read from an RDS, we avoid having to run the code which created the object again. Instead, we simply have access to the object. This is very convenient for any code which takes a long time to run, such as intensive data manipulation.

Restart your R session with `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + 0`. As always, this will require you to "Terminate Jobs" your tutorial.

### Exercise 1

Go to `File -> New File -> R Script`. Save the file. Name the file `process_data.R`. The `.R` suffix will be added automatically.

In the Terminal, run `ls`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Make sure that `process_data.R` is one of these files. We often use scripts to record the exact steps we used in analyzing some data or in creating a graphic. We want our work to be reproducible. We will often need to perform the same work again, albeit with some changes. A script can make that much simpler.

### Exercise 2

Though an R script will use the libraries you already have loaded if executed interactively in the Console, it is good practice to include these at the top of the script. Any script you create should run correctly, even if you have just re-started R.

In `process_data.R`, load the **tidyverse** package using the `library()` command. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("process_data.R")
````

CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

Because this is a script, you don't need to create a code chunk. Scripts are most useful for work which simply creates an object, often a new data set or a graphic. 

### Exercise 3

Skip a line after `library(tidyverse)`. Again, this is a script, so there are no code chunks, but skipping a line in between substantively different parts of the code is a good idea. Add this code:

````
diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") 
````

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("process_data.R")
````

CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

The answer should look like this:

````
library(tidyverse)

diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") 
````

You should try to learn how to work in two ways. First is interactively, trying things at the Console. Seeing what happens. Going line-by-line. Second is writtenly --- yes, I just made up this word --- adding code to your script/QMD and then executing all the code at once. 

<!-- Could explain this better, maybe illustrate some step-by-step examples. -->

Of course, the best approach is to use these two methods during your analysis, depending on which is best for the next step you need to take. 

### Exercise 4

Place your cursor in `process_data.R` at `filter(z != 0) |>`. Hit `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`. This will cause the pipe to be pasted to the Console and then executed there. (Note that this should generate an error.) CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The cause of the error is the distinction between the two worlds: the world of the Console and the world of the Script. The Script includes `library(tidyverse)`. So, when you source `process_data.R` in the next question, everything works fine. The Console, however, knows nothing about the `diamonds` tibble or about commands like `select()` or `filter()`. Recall that we recently restarted R. So, the **tidyverse** library, which contains `diamonds` and those commands, has not been loaded in the Console. 

A line of code, like `library(tidyverse)`, might exist in a script, but unless/until that line is executed in the Console, the Console won't know anything about it.


### Exercise 5

"Source" the entire script by pressing the "Source" button on the upper right. This takes all the code from the script and feeds it, line-by-line, to the R Console. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 10)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````

  ℹ 6,764 more rows
  ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
> 
````

The output of the pipe is our new tibble with 6,764 rows.


### Exercise 6

Change the code so that the pipe, instead of just vomiting out its result for printing, assigns that result to a new object, named `D_diamonds`. Your script should look like:

````
library(tidyverse)

D_diamonds <- diamonds |> 
  filter(z != 0) |> 
  filter(color == "D") 
````

Source the new script. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
> source("~/Desktop/projects/website-3/process_data.R", echo=TRUE)

> library(tidyverse)

> D_diamonds <- diamonds |> 
+   filter(z != 0) |> 
+   filter(color == "D") 
>
````

Notice how different this looks from the previous output. 

First, none of the messages associated with the **tidyverse** package are displayed. R only shows these messages the first time you load the package in a session. 

Second, the rows of the tibble are not shown because the pipe no longer just vomits them out at the end. Instead, the results of the pipe are assigned to a new object: `D_diamonds`. Assignment does not result in printed output. 


### Exercise 7

From the Console, run `ls()`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

````
> ls()
[1] "D_diamonds"
> 
````

### 

We have created a new object in the environment called `D_diamonds`. You can also see this object if you click on the Environment tab within the Environment pane. The name `D_diamonds` is meant to remind us that all the diamonds in this tibble are of color "D."


### Exercise 8

Restart your R session again. You can never restart your R session too often! The best way to do this is with the shortcut command: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + 0`. (This is the number zero, not the letter "O.")

From the Console, run `ls()`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-8}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> ls()
character(0)
> 
````

`D_diamonds` has disappeared! Objects in the R environment vanish once R restarts. And that is OK! We have the script, `process_data.R`, which allows us to recreate the object whenever we want.

### Exercise 9

Source `process_data.R`. From the Console, run `ls()`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-9}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

`D_diamonds` is back! If you type `D_diamonds` at the Console and hit "Enter," the contents of the tibble will appear.

### Exercise 10

It is often useful to save a permanent copy of an R object like a plot or a tibble. [`write_rds()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_rds.html) from the **readr** package is the most common approach for tibbles.

From the Console, run `write_rds(D_diamonds, file = "clean_data.rds")`. This function does not produce any output. The first argument is the R object(s) which you want to save. The second argument is the name of the file which will hold that object.

From the Console, run `list.files(pattern = "clean")`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-10}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> list.files(pattern = "clean")
[1] "clean_data.rds"
> 
````

The `pattern` argument to `list.files()` allows us to only look for files which match a regular expression.

There are now three objects associated with our tibble: 

* The script, `process_data.R`, which we used to create it. 

* The R object, `D_diamonds`, which only exists in the R session in which it was created. 

* The RDS object, `clean_data.rds`, which contains the data and which continues to exist even after the R session ends. Indeed, the RDS object can be committed and pushed to GitHub. (But be careful of pushing large objects (greater than 100 megabytes) to GitHub.)


### Exercise 11

Restart your R session with `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + 0`. When R restarts, you should still be in the `website-3` project. At the Console, run `library(tidyverse)`. We need to reload the **tidyverse** every time we restart R.

At the Console, run `read_rds("clean_data.rds")`. CP/CR.


```{r using-an-rds-file-11}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````

````

The value returned by `read_rds()` is whatever is contained in the RDS object. In this case, that is a tibble. But, when the object at the Console is a tibble, the contents of the tibble are just printed out, as here.


### Exercise 12

Open the `process_data`.R` script. At the bottom, skip a line after the pipe and then add this line (the same one we just executed at the Console):

````
write_rds(D_diamonds, file = "clean_data.rds")
````

It is separate from, and unconnected to, the pipe which creates the `D_diamonds` tibble. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("process_data.R")
````

CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-12}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

This is a common approach to scripts which are parts of larger projects. They finish by saving an object which is then used by other code in the project.

### Exercise 13

Source `process_data.R`. The easiest way of doing so, as before, is to open the file in the Source pane and then click the "Source" button.

In the Terminal, run `ls clean*`. CP/CR.

```{r using-an-rds-file-13}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
Davids-MBP:website-3 dkane$ ls clean*
clean_data.rds
Davids-MBP:website-3 dkane$ 
````

`clean*` is a regular expression which matches any file which begins with the letters `clean`. 

Think about the overall workflow.

* First, we worked interactively, just playing around with plots in `index.qmd`, trying to figure out what works.

* Second, once we had a good idea of what we were doing, we moved to a script, `process_data.R`. We don't want that code to be re-run every time we update `index.qmd`. So, we move some of the work to a script, to be run interactively whenever we need to change something.

* Third, we changed the script so that its final output was a permanent object. Later parts of the process can just begin with `clean_data.rds`.


## Using a PNG file
### 

A PNG file allows us to save any R graphic in a file. When we use a PNG, we avoid having to re-run the code which created it. This is very convenient for graphics which take a long time to create.

### Exercise 1

Go to `File -> New File -> R Script`. Press save in the left of the top panel. Name the file `make_plot.R`. The `.R` suffix will be added automatically.

In the Terminal, run `ls`. CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

Make sure that `make_plot.R` is one of these files. We often use scripts to record the exact steps we used in creating a graphic. We want our work to be reproducible. We will often need to perform the same work again, albeit with some small changes. A script can make that much simpler.

### Exercise 2

Though an R script will use the libraries you already have loaded if executed interactively in the Console, it is good practice to include these at the top of the script. Any script you create should run correctly, even if you have just re-started R.

In the R script, load the **tidyverse** package using the `library()` command. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("make_plot.R")
````

CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Naming conventions are important. It is fine to have dashes in a code chunk label. However, any object which might be used from the Terminal, like the name of a script, should avoid dashes because the Terminal interprets a dash as a special character, not necessarily as part of the file name. 

### Exercise 3

Copy this code into `make_plot.R`, after skipping a line after `library(tidyverse)`.  Save the R script.

````
x <- read_rds("clean_data.rds")

x |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(title = "Prices and Sizes for Diamonds of Color D",
         subtitle = "'Round' carat values like 1, 1.5 and 2 are more common.",
         x = "Carat",
         y = "Price")
````

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("make_plot.R")
````

CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

The code does two things. 

First, it reads the tibble from `clean_data.rds` and assigns that tibble to `x`. (The fact that, in our `process_data.R` script, this data was named `D_diamonds` is irrelevant. `write_rds()` just saves the tibble, not the *name* of the tibble.)

Second, it starts a new pipe with `x` and then creates our plot. Because the plot is not assigned to an object, it is just spat back out, and then shows up in the Plots tab.


### Exercise 4

Source the entire script by pressing the "Source" button. This takes all the code from the script and feeds it, line-by-line, to the R Console. CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like:

````
> source("~/Desktop/projects/website-3/make_plot.R", echo=TRUE)

> library(tidyverse)

> x <- read_rds("clean_data.rds")

> x |> 
+   ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
+     geom_point() +
+     scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
+     labs(titl .... [TRUNCATED] 
> 
````

At this point, we face the same problem as we faced when working on `process_data.R`. The script creates the object, in this case a graphic, which we want. But we need a way to save a permanent copy of that object.

### Exercise 5

Edit `make_plot.R` in two ways. First, assign the plot to an object named `D_plot`. Second, insert, after the graphic pipe, `ggsave("size_v_weight.png", D_plot)`. 

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("make_plot.R")
````

CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 8)
```

### 

You answer should look like this:

````
library(tidyverse)
x <- read_rds("clean_data.rds")

D_plot <- x |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(title = "Prices and Sizes for Diamonds of Color D",
         subtitle = "'Round' carat values like 1, 1.5 and 2 are more common.",
         x = "Carat",
         y = "Price")
         
ggsave("size_v_weight.png", D_plot)
````

As with `clean_data.R`, we have created a script which encapsulates, from start-to-finish, a discrete part of our analysis. In this case, we start from the tibble saved in `clean_data.rds` and finish by saving a graphic in `size_v_weight.png`.

### Exercise 6

Source `make_plot.R`. From the Console, run `list.files()`. CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

There are a lot of files! Note the new script `make_plot.R`, the object with which it starts, `clean_data.rds`, and the object which it creates, `size_v_weight.png`. 


### Exercise 7

Open the `index.qmd` file. In the `setup` code chunk, add `library(knitr)`. In the second code chunk, delete all the plotting code. Replace it all with `knitr::include_graphics("size_v_weight.png")`. Save the file.

In the Console, run:

````
show_file("index.qmd")
````

CP/CR.

```{r using-a-png-file-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Your answer should look like this:

<!-- DK: Very annoying that we need this hack, but if you just include this text with four backticks, R still runs the R code, generating two failures: duplicate "setup" code chunk names and non-existent PNG file.  -->

<!-- DK: Or maybe it is overkill to show what the answer looks like. Students mostly got it right anyway! -->

```{r file = "images/index_example.txt", echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```

There was nothing wrong, *per se* with having the plotting code in `index.qmd` rather than `make_plot.R`. The problem arises when that plotting code takes a long time to run, as it often will. We don't want to re-run all the code each time we make a small change to the website. It is much better to separate out the plotting code and only run it when we need to.

### Exercise 8

From the Terminal, run `quarto publish gh-pages`. You will need to hit "Enter" at least once. CP/CR.


```{r using-a-png-file-8}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Note the workflow. At the start, we created a pipe in `index.qmd` which does everything and then, later, we moved the code into separate scripts so that we don't need to run all the analysis each time we render the website. This is a very common approach. First, get something working. Second, organize and clean it all up. 

In a complex project, we will often create directories --- like `code`, `data`, and `images` --- into which we will place files like `process_data.R`, `clean_data.rds`, and `size_v_weight.png`, respectively.

### Exercise 9

Look up the help page for `theme_minimal()` by running `?theme_minimal` at the Console. Copy-and-paste the Description.

```{r using-a-png-file-9}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Graphics on the web often appear differently than graphics on your computer, so [many people find it useful](https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/08/themes-to-improve-your-ggplot-figures) to increase the size of the text in their graphics. [A simple way](https://minimaxir.com/2017/08/ggplot2-web/) to do that is to add `theme_minimal(base_size = 18)` to your plot creation code. Fortunately, doing so is as simple as editing and then re-running `make_plot.R`.

### Exercise 10

Look up the help page for `ggsave()`. Copy-and-paste the Description.

```{r using-a-png-file-10}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

When saving graphics for web display, it is often useful to specify their exact size with a command like `ggsave("your-file.png", your-plot, width = 4, height = 3)`. An earlier edition of [*ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis*](https://ggplot2-book.org/) also [notes](https://bookdown.dongzhuoer.com/hadley/ggplot2-book/saving) that:

> For raster graphics (i.e. .png, .jpg), the dpi argument controls the resolution of the plot. It defaults to 300, which is appropriate for most printers, but you may want to use 600 for particularly high-resolution output, or 96 for on-screen (e.g., web) display.
