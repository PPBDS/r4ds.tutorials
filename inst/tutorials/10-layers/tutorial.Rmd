## Introduction
### 

This tutorial covers [Chapter 10: Layers](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/layers.html) from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. You will learn how to use [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and related packages to create persuasive graphics. 

<!-- BOOK MATERIAL GOES HERE. -->


## Aesthetic mappings: Simple `geom_point()`
### 

### Exercise 1
View all of the data in `mpg` by using `glimpse()` on it

```{r aesthetic-mappings-simple-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r aesthetic-mappings-simple-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(mpg)
```

### 
The mpg dataset includes information regarding several cars and all of the data that represents all of them.

###

### Exercise 2
Load the `tidyverse` library because that will be used with the mpg data

```{r aesthetic-mappings-simple-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r aesthetic-mappings-2-simple-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

### 

“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.” — John Tukey

### Exercise 3
We are now going to plot the `mpg` data on to a graph through `ggplot`

```{r aesthetic-mappings-simple-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r aesthetic-mappings-3-simple-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg)
```

###

Note that this just creates an empty area in which a plot can be placed.

### Exercise 4
We are now going to set x to `displ` and y to `hwy` on the graph to view the car’s engine size plotted with the car’s fuel efficiency on the highway.

```{r aesthetic-mappings-simple-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r aesthetic-mappings-4-simple-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = ..., ... = hwy))
```

### 

We want to visualize the relationship between the car's engine size and how it correlates to the car's fuel efficiency on the highway

###

### Exercise 5
Let's add some color to this graph. Set color to `class` which will separate each color based on the `class` of the car.

```{r aesthetic-mappings-simple-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r aesthetic-mappings-5-simple-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = ...))
```

### 

We want to add some color to this graph so we can separate the different types of cars present in the dataset.

###

### Exercise 6
Finally let's plot the points with the use of `geom_point()` to visualize the data and view all of the colors.

```{r aesthetic-mappings-simple-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r aesthetic-mappings-simple-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point()
```

### 

## Aesthetic mappings: Advanced `geom_point()`

### 

When you are working with data sets that have over a thousand data points, you will have overplotting. In this section, you will learn to minimize the overplotting by changing the size of each point.

### 

Let's make this scatterplot using `geom_point()`.

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-0}
point_p2 <- ggplot(data = diamonds,
                 mapping = aes(x = price,
                              y = carat,
                              color = clarity)) +
  geom_point(size = .25, alpha = .5) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_few() +
  labs(title = "Diamond Carat and Price",
       subtitle = "3+ carat diamonds are rare and of low quality",
       x = "Price",
       y =  "Carat",
       color = "Clarity",
       caption = "Source: R datasets")

point_p2
```

### Exercise 1

Type `?diamonds` to look at the help page for the `diamonds` tibble. If you cannot run it in your code chunk below, run it in your console. Remember to load `library(tidyverse)` beforehand.

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?diamonds
```

### Exercise 2

Explore the `diamonds` dataset. Since we are looking at the "carats" and "clarity" categories, copy and paste the definitions for "carats" and "clarity" below.

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-2}
  question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### Exercise 3

Start a new pipe with `diamonds`. Select the columns `carat`, `price`, and `clarity`.

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
diamonds |>
  select(carat, price, clarity)
```

### Exercise 4

Continue your pipe and add `ggplot()`. Map `price` to the x-axis, `carat` to the y-axis, and `clarity` to `color`.

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
geom_point() is a layer so use + to add it
```

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-4-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ...,
                       y = ...,
                       color = ...)) +
  geom_point()
```

### 

`ggplot()` contains two specific uses: color and shape. We often use color when we are dealing with a vast amount of data. When compared to color, shape can only use up to 6 discrete values, meaning that we cannot utilize shape to its fullest with more data. We use fill when we are dealing with other objects.

### Exercise 5

There are several ways to minimize overplotting. One such way is through the use of `alpha`. First, within `geom_point()` set `alpha` to 0.5.

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_point(alpha = ...)
```

### 

With the use of alpha we can control the transparency of the dots.

### Exercise 6

Now, within `geom_point()` set `size` to .25.

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5,
             size = ...)
```

### 

Size controls the diameter of the points. The default diameter size is 1.

### Exercise 7

Use the layer `scale_x_log10()` function to make the scale of the plot logarithmic.

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Remembder you are adding a layers here so use +
```

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-7-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... +
  scale_x_log10()
```

### 

Remember: a logarithmic scale means that each increment increases by a factor of the base of the logarithm. In our case, that's base 10. We want to implement the use of a logarithmic scale here because we want to be able to visualize all of our data without having any of it too close to each other.

### Exercise 8

Good! Now to change the theme of the plot, add another layer. This layer should be `theme_few()`.

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  theme_few()
```

### 

This theme is in `ggthemes`. Remember, there are some themes that are built into the `tidyverse` package, and some that are not. If you want to use themes that aren't in `tidyverse`, you must load `library(ggthemes)`.

###

Besides the themes that we have used, [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html) contains all aesthetic specifications that are possible for the data. In addition, [**ggplot2: elegant graphics**](https://ggplot2-book.org/) provides all possible aesthetics that any user will use.

### Exercise 9

To finish your plot, use `labs()` to give the graph a title, subtitle, axis labels, legend label, and caption of your choosing. To set the legend label, use the argument `color`.

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r}
point_p2
```

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r aesthetic-mappings-advanced-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(...,
       color = "Clarity",
       ...)
```

### 

Now we know how to minimize the over plotting, it will come in handy in future graphs. Remember that another way to minimize the over plotting is through `geom_jitter()`.

## Geometric Objects with `geom_smooth()`
### 

In this exercise, we will map Joe Biden's approval rating until June 30th, the first ~6 months of his term. We will explore different types of `geom_smooth()` in this section.


### 

We will be attempting to recreate this plot below.

```{r}
biden_p <- ggplot(data = polling_data, 
       mapping = aes(x = createddate,
                     y = rate,
                     color = approval_type)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "gam",
              formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs"),
              se = TRUE) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Biden's Approval Rating From Jan 22 to Jun 30",
       subtitle = "While Biden's approval rating has stayed relatively static, his disapproval rating \nhas been rising.",
       color = "",
       caption = "Source: Five Thirty Eight Data")

biden_p
```

### Exercise 1

We will first explore the file that contains this data. Run `summary()` on `polling_data` in the console below.

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
summary(...)
```

### 

This data was taken from the fivethirtyeight website. You will learn how to modify data into CSVs and use them in R in a later tutorial.

### Exercise 2

Write down the name of the three column headers.

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-2}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "createddate, rate, approval_type",
	answer(NULL,
	correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

`createddate` stands for the day the poll was finished. `rate` is the % of approval or disapproval, and `approval_type` indicates whether or not the rate is approval or disapproval.

### Exercise 3

We will get started building the plot. Start the function `ggplot()`, and set the argument `data` to `polling_data`.

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = ...)
```

### 

Remember: you should not see a plot here as you have not mapped anything, nor do you have a geom layer. 

### Exercise 4

Now, map `createddate` to the x-axis, and map `rate` to the y-axis.

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = polling_data,
       mapping = aes(x = ...,
                     y = ...))
```

### 

`createddate` is a date column, and `rate` is a double column.

### Exercise 5

We want to be able to see both Joe Biden's approval and disapproval rate. Therefore, we'll change the color of the dots depending on whether the dot represents an approval/disapproval rating. Set `color` to `approval_type`.

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = polling_data,
       mapping = aes(x = createddate,
                     y = rate,
                     color = ...))
```

### 

Every geom function in ggplot2 takes a mapping argument, either defined locally in the geom layer or globally in the `ggplot()` layer. However, not every aesthetic works with every geom. Now we're ready to start building the plot.

### Exercise 6

Next, we will add the points to the graph. Add the layer `geom_point()`.

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = polling_data,
       mapping = aes(x = createddate,
                     y = rate,
                     color = approval_type)) +
  geom_point()
```

### 

Currently, we have a bit of overplotting. We will rectify this in the next code chunk.

### Exercise 7

Set the argument `alpha` to 0.5.

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = ...,
       mapping = aes(x = ...,
                     y = ...,
                     color = ...)) +
  geom_point(alpha = ...)
```

### 

Good! Now you should be able to see more distinct points.

### Exercise 8

We want to see the trend line for Biden's approval/disapproval ratings throughout his term. Add the layer of `geom_smooth().`

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  geom_smooth()
```

### 

If you just add this layer, you will get a few warning messages. We will fix this in the following exercises. If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings for that layer only. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers.

### Exercise 9

Within `geom_smooth()`, set the method argument to "gam". We use "gam" since there is a large quantity of data points.

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  geom_smooth(method = ...)
```

### 

"gam" stands for **generalized additive model**. It is a modified form of a linear model. If you are curious to learn more, [GAMs in R](https://noamross.github.io/gams-in-r-course/chapter1) is a good resource.

### Exercise 10

Next, within `geom_smooth()` still, set the argument formula to `y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")`.

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  geom_smooth(method = ...,
              formula = ...)
```

### 

Just like y ~ x indicates a relationship between x and y, `y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")` indicates a "generalized additive model" relationship. With a generalized additive model we are able to handle large data well.

### Exercise 11

Finally, set `se = TRUE`.

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  geom_smooth(method = ...,
              formula = ...,
              se = ...)
```

### 

Remember, this creates a margin of error.

### Exercise 12

Since the data comes from the FiveThirtyEight website, we will use the fivethirtyeight theme! Add `theme_fivethirtyeight()` to your plot.

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  geom_smooth(method = ...,
              formula = ...,
              se = ...) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

### 

Note: the FiveThirtyEight theme actually comes from the `ggthemes()` package, not the FiveThirtyEight package.

### Exercise 13

Next, we want to change the labels on the graph so they are in percentage format. Use scale_y_continuous to do so. Set the `labels` argument to `scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)`.

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

### 

We use scale_y_continuous when we want to modify the y-axis for continuous data. [This documentation here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_continuous.html) will tell you more, and all the possible arguments you can use with scale_y_continuous.

### Exercise 14

Finally, use `labs()` to add an appropriate heading, subtitle, caption, etc. 

Reminder - your graph should look like this:

```{r}
biden_p
```

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-with-smooth-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(title = ...,
       subtitle = ...,
       color = ...,
       caption = ...)
```

### 

Good! Now you have a plot of Biden's approval rating for the first six months of his term.

## Geometric Objects with `geom_histogram()` and `geom_boxplot()`
### 

<!-- NL: This example should also include how to make and label breaks so that they correspond to histogram bins. Finding out the default histogram bin size is not simple (`ggplot_build`). Better might be to introduce the `center` and/or `boundary` arguments together with `binwidth`.  -->

Let's create the following histogram.

```{r}
hist_p <- mpg |> 
  mutate(year = as.character(year)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(cty, fill = year)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 6,
                 color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of City Fuel Efficiency in 1999 and 2008 Models", 
       subtitle = "1999 had more models of high city fuel efficiency", 
       x = "City MPG", 
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Year",
       caption = "Source: EPA") 

hist_p
```

### Exercise 1

Run `?mpg` in the code chunk below. 

```{r geometric-objects-wi-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

This dataset is about fuel economy of cars from the Environmental Protection Agency. 

### Exercise 2

Run `glimpse()` on the mpg data set. Take a look at the different variables available.

```{r geometric-objects-wi-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-wi-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(mpg)
```

### 

The variables that we care about are `year` and `cty`. Year indicates the year of manufacture, and cty indicates the city miles per gallon.

### Exercise 3

Use the `$` to extract the column `year` as a vector.

```{r geometric-objects-wi-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r geometric-objects-wi-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
mpg$year
```

### 

Notice that there are only two different years, 1999 and 2008.

### Exercise 4

Start a new pipe with `mpg`. Use `mutate()` and the function `as.character()` to change the `year` column from a numeric variable to a character variable.

```{r geometric-objects-wi-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r geometric-objects-wi-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...  |> 
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

### 

We make this change so that we can use year as a fill color when we plot. 

### Exercise 5

Select the columns `year` and `cty`.

```{r geometric-objects-wi-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-wi-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...  |> 
  select(..., ...)
```

### Exercise 6

Continue your pipe and add `ggplot()`. Map `cty` to the x-axis and `year`  to `fill`.

```{r geometric-objects-wi-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>


```{r geometric-objects-wi-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ..., fill = ...))
```

### 

Again, you should not see anything. The `geom` layer is what displays objects on the plot.

### Exercise 7

Now, we will add a geom layer. Add the layer `geom_histogram()`. 

```{r geometric-objects-wi-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-wi-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
geom_histogram() is a layer so use + to add it
```

```{r geometric-objects-wi-7-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
...|> 
  ... +
  geom_histogram()
```

### 

You may notice that there are too many "bins" for our liking. We'll change this now.

### Exercise 8

Within `geom_histogram()` set the number of `bins` to 6.

```{r geometric-objects-wi-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-wi-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_histogram(bins = ...)
```

You can change the width of each bin with the `binwidth` argument. We won't be doing that now, but you can do that in future plots.

### Exercise 9

Within `geom_histogram()` set  `color` to `"black"`. 

```{r geometric-objects-wi-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-wi-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_histogram(bins = 6, 
                 color = "black")
```

Remember, `color` only changes the outline of the bars. If you want to change the fill, use `fill`. 

### Exercise 10

To finish your plot, use `labs()` to give the graph a title, subtitle, axis labels, legend labels, and caption of your choosing. To change the legend labels use the argument `fill`. 

```{r geometric-objects-wi-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-wi-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(..., 
       fill = "Year",
       ...)
```

Reminder: This is what your graph should look like. 

```{r show-hist-p}
hist_p
```

### 

In the previous graph we used `color` to change the legend labels, while here we used `fill`. The argument within labels matches the argument you use within `ggplot()`. `color` is used for objects like lines and points. `fill` is used for larger shapes. 

Are you satisfied with the way we have made the bin sizes? Do the axes labels make this easy to understand? We will do better later. 

[**Histograms**](https://socviz.co/groupfacettx.html#histograms) contain many more vast resources with items that contain comparing distributions in a new way.

### Exercise 11
Let's try the same data for before but with a `geom_boxplot()` instead of a `geom_histogram()`. Boxplots compute the five-number summary of the distribution and then display that summary as a specially formatted box.

```{r geometric-objects-wi-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geometric-objects-wi-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_boxplot()

### 

ggplot2 provides a vast amount of opportunities, however, there are a countless number of plots that can be made through different geoms and extensions. Check out [**possible options**](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/) for any future implementations or future possibilties for you to conduct. 

## Geometric Objects with `geom_density()`
### 

Let's create the following density plot.

```{r}
dens_p <- trains |> 
  filter(age >= 40) |> 
  ggplot(aes(age, fill = party)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  xlim(40, 75) +
  labs (title = "Age of Democrats and Republicans in Trains Experiment",
        subtitle = "More seniors are democrats in the experiment",
        x = "Age",
        y = "Density",
        fill = "Party",
        caption = " Source: Enos (2014)")

dens_p
```

### Exercise 1

Type `trains` to view the data set. 

```{r geomdensity-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

### Exercise 2

Use the `$` operator to extract the `age` column as a vector. 

```{r geomdensity-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

### 

The numbers in square brackets help you keep track of what row the number belongs to.

### Exercise 3

Start a new pipe with `trains`. Filter for rows in which `age` is greater than or equal to 40.

```{r geomdensity-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r geomdensity-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  filter(age >= ...)
```

### Exercise 4

 
Select the columns `age` and `party`.

```{r geomdensity-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geomdensity-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  filter(...) |> 
  select(..., ...)
```

### Exercise 5

Use `ggplot()` to map `age` to the x-axis. Also add the layer `geom_density()`.

```{r geomdensity-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geomdensity-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(mapping = aes(x =..., 
                     y = ...))+
  geom_density()
```

### Exercise 6

Set `fill` to `party`. 

```{r geomdensity-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geomdensity-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Recall fill goes inside the aes() argument of ggplot()
```

Right now, the two plots overlap each other. We will change the transparency so we can see both parties clearly.

### Exercise 7

Within `geom_density()` set the `alpha` argument to .5. 

```{r geomdensity-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geomdensity-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

### Exercise 8

Let's also add an `xlim()` function, to set the range of x values on our plot from 40 to 75. This way, we can see the full distributions.

```{r geomdensity-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geomdensity-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Make sure you put a comma between 40 and 75 within the xlim() function.
```

```{r geomdensity-8-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... +
  xlim(40, 75)
```

### Exercise 9

To finish your plot, use `labs()` to give the graph a title, subtitle, axis labels, and caption of your choosing.

```{r geomdensity-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geomdensity-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(..., 
       fill = "...",
       ...)
```

Reminder: This is what our plot should look like.

```{r}
dens_p
```

###
You can completely transform the look of your plot by changing its geom, and different geoms can reveal different features of your data. The density graph that we plotted in this example is different from the features presented in the boxplot and histogram graph.

## Facets and Statistical Transformations with `geom_col()`, `facet_wrap()`, and `facet_grid()`
### 

Let's make the same plot, using a related function, `geom_col()`. Unlike `geom_bar()`, you have to specify the value for the y-axis when using this function. 
```{r make-col-p}
col_p <- trains  |> 
  summarize(total = n(),
            .by = c(race, line, treatment)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = race, y = total, fill = line)) +
    geom_col() +
    facet_wrap(~ treatment) +
    theme_classic() +
    labs(title = "Starting Attitudes Toward Immigration Issue",
         subtitle = "Higher proportion of minorities among treated participants",
         x = "Race",
         y = "Number of Participants",
         fill = "Line",
         caption = "Source: Enos (2014)")
col_p
```

### Exercise 1

Start a pipe with `trains`. Select the columns `race`, `treatment` and `line`. 

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  select(..., ..., ...)
```

### Exercise 2

Copy/paste the previous code. Use `summarize()` to create a new table with the column `total` which is equal to the function `n()`. 

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  summarize(total = ...)
```

```{r geomcol-2-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  summarize(total = n())
```

### Exercise 3

Add a `.by` argument to `summarize()` with the value set to `race`, `treatment`, and `line`. You need to place these three values with a vector using `c()`. 

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  summarize(total = n(),
            .by = c(..., ..., ...))  
```
 
### 

Note that there are no Blacks or Hispanics from the Franklin Line in the Control Group. 

### Exercise 4

Continue your pipe with `ggplot()`. Map the variable `race` to the x-axis. Map total to the `y` axis. Add the layer `geom_col()`.

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = ..., 
           y = ...) +
  geom_col()
```

### 

`geom_col()` will automatically take the three to four values for each `race` in the `total` column and stack them to form one bar. This behavior is from the fact that the `position` argument for `geom_col()` is set by default to "stack". 

### Exercise 5

Now, map `line` to `fill`.

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = ... , 
          aes(x = race, 
              fill = ...) +
  geom_col()
```

### Exercise 6

Add the layer `facet_wrap` and facet by the variable `treatment`. 

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  facet_wrap(~ ...)
```

### Exercise 7

We won't be implementing this within our plot grid, however, another way to view our data is through `facet_grid()` through `treatment ~ race`. This will open up a grid which will display each of the variables in their own respective grid. (Make sure to get rid of the `facet_wrap()` from the previous exercise when trying this exercise out, and implement `facet_wrap()` after this exercise again)

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  facet_grid(treatment ~ race)
```

### Exercise 8

Let's add a theme to our graph. Add the layer `theme_classic()` to your code. 

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  theme_classic()
```

### Exercise 9

To finish your plot, use `labs()` to give the graph a title, subtitle, axes labels, legend labels,  and caption of your choosing.

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r}
col_p
```

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facets-statistical-transformations-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(..., 
       fill = "...",
       ...)
```

###
Through this we are able to view our data with a `facet_wrap` which splits a plot into subplots that each display one subset of the data based on a categorical variable.

## Statistical Transformations and Position Adjustments with `geom_bar()`
### 

Let's create this graph using `geom_bar()`.

```{r}
bar_p <- ggplot(data = trains, 
                   mapping = aes(x = station, 
                                 fill = race)) + 
  geom_bar(alpha = 1/5, 
           position = "dodge") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, 
                                   hjust=1)) + 
  labs(title = "Race found at each station",
       subtitle = "The most popular station with the most common race found within each station",
       x = "Station",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Race")

bar_p
```

### Exercise 1

Skim the `trains` data set. 

```{r statistical-transfor-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

### 

Notice that there are no missing values for `station`. This means we do not need to use `drop_na`.  

### Exercise 2

Add `ggplot()` and map `station` to the x axis of the `trains` data and set `fill` to `race`.

```{r statistical-transfor-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r statistical-transfor-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = ..., 
       mapping = aes(x =..., fill =...))
```

### 

Here we have used `station` data on the x axis and the count on the y axis is automatically implemented. Within a bar graph, we only input the x variable due to the y variable automatically being created usually as count. Through this we can see count within each `station` in the `trains` data.

### Exercise 3
Add the layer `geom_bar()`.

```{r statistical-transfor-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r statistical-transfor-3-hint, eval = FALSE}

```

###
This will result in a basic bar chart that has been implemented



### Exercise 4

Within `geom_bar()`, set `alpha` to 1/5, `position` to `"dodge"`.

```{r statistical-transfor-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r statistical-transfor-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + geom_bar(alpha = 1/5, position = "dodge")
```

### Exercise 5

Now we are going to use theme to adjust the labels for station. As you can see they are all bunched up together and we can fix this through an adjustment of how they are positioned. Set `axis.text.x` to `element_text`. Within `element_text` set `angle` to 45 and `hjust` to 1.

```{r statistical-transfor-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r statistical-transfor-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, 
                                   hjust=1))
```

### Exercise 6

Finally, use `labs()` to give the graph a title, subtitle, axis labels, legend labels, and caption of your choosing.

```{r statistical-transfor-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r statistical-transfor-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(..., 
       fill = "...",
       ...)
```

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r make-bar-p}
bar_p
```

### 

We like using bar charts here because they bin your data and then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.

## Coordinate Systems
Coordinate systems are probably the most complicated part of ggplot2. The default coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system where the x and y positions act independently to determine the location of each point. We are going to create one of these systems with the US.

### Exercise 1
Install and load the `maps` package

```{r coordinate-systems-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r coordinate-systems-1-hint, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('maps')
library(maps)
```

### Exercise 2
Set nz to the map_data of nz

```{r coordinate-systems-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r coordinate-systems-2-hint, eval = FALSE}
nz <- map_data('nz')
```

### Exercise 3
We now want to plot our nz data with `ggplot`

```{r coordinate-systems-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r coordinate-systems-3-hint, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(nz)
```

###

We don't have to use data = nz in this case because it is in the first variable spot and we don't have to specify this case.

### Exercise 4
Set x to `long` and y to `lat` and group to `group`

```{r coordinate-systems-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r coordinate-systems-4-hint, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(..., aes(x = ..., 
                y = ...,
                group = ...))
```

### Exercise 5
Now we want to plot this through the use of `geom_polygon()`

```{r coordinate-systems-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r coordinate-systems-5-hint, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_polygon()
```

### Exercise 6
Now we want to add color the item that we have plotted. Set `fill` to white and `color` to black

```{r coordinate-systems-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r coordinate-systems-6-hint, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_polygon(fill = ..., color = ...)
```

### Exercise 7
Finally let us use the `coord_quickmap()` which sets the aspect ratio correctly for geographic maps. This is very important because we are plotting spatial data with `ggplot2`

```{r coordinate-systems-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r coordinate-systems-7-hint, eval = FALSE}
... +
  coord_quickmap()
```

###
Now you should see the New Zealand data plotted out based on the spatial data. We can visualize more data through `coord_polar()`. Take a look at the functions of [**coord_polar()**](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/layers.html#coordinate-systems)

## Make a `plotly` graph
### 

`plotly` allows us to make interactive graphs. It's  especially useful with `geom_point()`. Hover over the points to see more information about them.

```{r make-plotly}
nominate_plot <- nominate |> 
  filter(congress == 116) |> 
  ggplot(aes(nominate_dim1, nominate_dim2, color = party,
             text = paste("Name:", name, "\n",
                                    "State:", state, "\n",
                                     "Chamber:", chamber))) +
  geom_point(size = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Economic and Social Ideology of 116th U.S. Congress", 
       x = "Economic Ideology", 
       y = "Social Ideology", 
       color = "Party",
       caption = "Voteview")

nom_p <- ggplotly(nominate_plot, tooltip = "text")

nom_p
```

### Exercise 1

Run `?nominate` to open the help page for the nominate data set. 

```{r plotly-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

### Exercise 2

Start a new pipe with `nominate`. Arrange the tibble by `congress` in descending order to find the number of the most recent congress in the data set. 

```{r plotly-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r plotly-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  arrange(desc(...))
```

### 

The most recent congress is the 116th. 

### Exercise 3

Start a new pipe with `nominate`. Filter to keep rows in which the value of `congress` is 116. 

```{r plotly-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r plotly-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  filter(congress == ...)
```

The variable `congress` indicates the number of Congress, i.e. the 116th Congress being Congress from 2019-2021, the 115th Congress from 2017-2019, etc. 
### Exercise 4

Drop any rows with `N/A` values in the `nominate_dim1` and `nominate_dim2` columns with `drop_na()`. 

```{r plotly-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r plotly-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  drop_na(..., ...)
```

### Exercise 5

Select the columns `nominate_dim1`, `nominate_dim2`, `party`, `name`, `state`, and `chamber`. 

```{r plotly-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r plotly-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  select(..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ...)
```

### Exercise 6

Use `ggplot()` and `aes()` to map `nominate_dim1` to `x` and `nominate_dim2` to `y`. 

```{r plotly-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r plotly-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ...,
                       y = ...))
```

### Exercise 7

Add the layer `geom_point().`

```{r plotly-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r plotly-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ...,
                       y = ...)) +
    geom_point()
```

### 

Currently, we can't tell the difference between parties. We will fix this by changing the colours to represent each party.

### Exercise 8

Map `party` to `color` within aes(). Within `geom_point()` set the argument `size` to 0.8.

```{r plotly-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r plotly-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ..., 
                       y = ..., 
                       color = ...))
```

### Exercise 9

Within geom_point(), set the argument `size` to 0.8. 

```{r plotly-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r plotly-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ..., 
                       y = ..., 
                       color = ...)) +
  geom_point()
```

### 

### Exercise 10

Within `aes()` in `ggplot()`, add the argument `text` and set this equal to the function `paste`. This will return an error because we have not assigned anything to `text` yet.  We will do this in the following exercises. 

```{r plotly-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r plotly-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ..., 
                       y = ..., 
                       color = ..., 
                       text = paste()))+ 
  geom_point(...)
```

The `paste` function allows quoted strings and variables to be combined into one string. We will use this function to create our `plotly` labels. Note, you should get an error during this.

### Exercise 11

Let's make the first line that will appear on our plotly label. Within `paste()`, first enter the string `"Name:"`. Separate this string by a comma a then write `name` without quotes, this is the column whose info we want to appear in this position on our label. Separate this by a comma, and then write `"\n"`. This is the symbol for a new line and it will not be printed. Keep this all on one line for the easiest formatting. Refer to the hint if needed.

```{r plotly-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r plotly-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ..., 
                       y = ..., 
                       color = ..., 
                       text = paste("Name:", name, "\n",
                                    ))) + 
  geom_point(...)
```

### Exercise 12

Let's make an equivalent label for a congressman's state. Place a comma after the `"\n"` from the previous exercise. On a new line within paste, enter the string `"State:"`. Separate this string by a comma and then write `state` without quotes. Separate this by a comma and then include the new line symbol, `"\n"`. 

```{r plotly-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r plotly-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ..., 
                       y = ..., 
                       color = ..., 
                       text = paste("Name:", name, "\n",
                                    "State:", state, "\n",
                                    ))) +
  geom_point(...)
```

### Exercise 13

Let's make an equivalent label for a congressman's chamber. Place a comma after the `"\n"` from the previous exercise. On a new line within paste, enter the string `"Chamber:"`. Separate this string by a comma and then write `chamber` without quotes. Since this is our final line, do not include another new line symbol, simply add the closing the parentheses (if it is not there already). 

```{r plotly-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r plotly-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ..., 
                       y = ..., 
                       color = ..., 
                       text = paste("Name:", name, "\n",
                                    "State:", state, "\n",
                                    "Chamber:", chamber))) +
  geom_point(...)
```

### Exercise 14

Use `labs()` to add a title, axes labels, legend labels, and a caption to your plot. `ggplotly()` does not support subtitles. 

```{r plotly-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r plotly-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
+ labs(title = "...",
       subtitle = "...",
       x = "...",
       y = "...",
       color = "...",
       caption = "...")
```

### Exercise 15

To make a graph with `plotly`, you need to save your `ggplot()` to an object in R, which you will use in the function `ggplotly`. Copy/paste your full pipe from the previous exercise and assignment. At the beginning of the pipe use the `<-` to assign this to an object named `nominate_plot`.

```{r plotly-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r plotly-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nominate_plot <- nominate |> 
  filter(congress == 116) 
  ...
```

### Exercise 16

Copy/paste the code from above. On a new line not connected to the pipe above, type the function `ggplotly()`. The first argument should be the name of the ggplot object, `nominate_plot`. Make the second argument `tooltip = "text"`. This tells `ggplotly()` to make the label based on what we have in the `text` argument in `ggplot()`.

```{r plotly-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r plotly-16-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nominate_plot <- nominate |> 
  filter(congress == 116) |> 
  ... 

ggplotly(nominate_plot, tooltip = "text")

```

Reminder: This is what your graph should look like. Test to make sure you can interact with your graph. 

```{r}
nom_p
```

### 

Plotly allows for users to interact with graphs and enter a vast new world which can provide users the opportunity to display their data in an whole new way. 

## Summary
### 

This tutorial covered [Chapter 10: Layers](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/layers.html) from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. You learned how to use [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and related packages to create persuasive graphics.

<!-- Note that the later material sucks! There are not enough knowledge drops.  -->

<!-- This was a bit too long. Also, much if it is sloppy! Need to revisit. -->

<!-- Change elements of theme.. -->

<!-- Each section should begin with two questions looking at the data, even if they are the same questions each time. print, glimpse, ? if it is in primer.data, even something ike trains$age can be informative. -->

<!-- Make the plots cooler! Add links to  https://ggplot2-book.org/. And https://socviz.co/. Or maybe put these in case studies. Love this one: https://socviz.co/groupfacettx.html#histograms. -->

<!--  Delete entire sections of you don't like them! Put in more ### as continue buttons. Drop some knowledge at the end of each exercise.  Always start by looking at the data with just print the data name (trains) or glimpse() or summary() or skim(). Always use select() for each question to keep just the variables you need. Nothing wrong with an arbitrary filter() in the pipe. Nothing wrong with using a simple mutate() to create a new variable, like change height to inches.
