## Introduction
### 

This tutorial covers [Chapter 11: Exploratory data analysis](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/eda.html) from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund.

## National Health and Nutrition Survey
### 

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a survey distributed to adults and children in the United States. 
It contains the personal and physical information of 10,000 Americans from two surveys in 2009 and 2011.


### 

Let's create the following plot.

```{r}
nhanes_p <- nhanes |>
  
  # more convenient and widespread to have measures in US system. 
  
  mutate(weight = weight * 2.2, height = height / 30.48) |>
  
  # BMI (body mass index) is a good measure to show the association of weight
  # and height. Moreover, I chose to analyse by gender, using facet_wrap.
  # Therefore, selected these variables.
  
  select(gender, weight, height, bmi) |>
  drop_na(weight, height) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = height, color = bmi)) +
    geom_jitter() +
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, 
                method = "loess", 
                formula = y ~ x) +
    facet_wrap(~ gender) + 
    theme_clean() + 
    labs(y = "Height (feet)",
         x = "Weight (pounds)",
         title = "Height Versus Weight in the US",
         subtitle = "Association between weight and height is more positive for heavy men",
         color = "BMI",
         caption = "Source: NHANES (National Health and Examination Survey)")

nhanes_p
```

### Exercise 1

To view all columns and some of the respective values, `glimpse()` the `nhanes` data set.

```{r national-health-and--1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r national-health-and--1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(...)
```

### 

In the tibble above, `weight` and `height` is measured in kg and cm, respectively.

### Exercise 2

Start a pipe with `nhanes`. Then use `mutate()` to multiply `weight` by 2.2 and divide `height` by 30.48 to convert units into pounds and feet. 

```{r national-health-and--2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r national-health-and--2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nhanes |>
  mutate(weight = ..., 
         height = ...)
```

```{r national-health-and--2-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
Use * to multiply and / to divide.
```

```{r national-health-and--2-hint-3, eval = FALSE}
nhanes |>
  mutate(weight = ... * ..., 
         height = ... / ...)
```

### Exercise 3

Continue your pipe, now `select()` the `gender`, `weight`, `height`, and `bmi` columns. 

```{r national-health-and--3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r national-health-and--3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  select(..., ..., ..., ...)
```

### 

There are a variety of "[selection helper](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/select_helpers.html)" functions which one can use with `select()`. One of them, `matches()`, allows us to do pattern matching. So, for example:

````
select(matches("ei"), gender, bmi) 
````

would select the same four columns as we do here because the only variables with an "ei" in their names are `weight` and `height`.

### Exercise 4

There are `NA` values for `height` or `weight` in some rows. Use `drop_na()` with the arguments `weight`and `height` to remove all rows with `NA` value in these columns.

```{r national-health-and--4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r national-health-and--4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  drop_na(..., ...)
```

### 

`drop_na()` without any arguments would drop all rows in which the value for any variable is NA.

### Exercise 5

Continue your pipe with `ggplot()`. Furthermore, add the layer `geom_jitter()` to make a jittered scatterplot. Map `weight` to the x-axis, `height` to the y-axis, and `bmi` to `color`.

```{r national-health-and--5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r national-health-and--5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = ..., 
             y = ..., 
             color = ...)) +
  geom_jitter()
```

### 

Instead of `geom_jitter()`, we also can use `geom_pointdensity()` function from **[ggpointdensity](https://github.com/LKremer/ggpointdensity)** package, which would color data points by how often they appear. 

### Exercise 6

A trend line will help you visualize the general association between variables. Add one with `geom_smooth()`. 

```{r national-health-and--6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r national-health-and--6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  geom_smooth()
```

### 

Because we haven't specified any arguments, line uses the default settings and gives a set of warnings. 

### Exercise 7

Set the `formula` argument to `y ~ x`.

```{r national-health-and--7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r national-health-and--7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
 geom_smooth(formula = ...)
```

### 

`formula` argument is used to specify the relationship between variables that the line is based on. Without specifying any arguments, `y ~ x` gives us a linear line. 

### Exercise 8

In addition, set the `method` argument to `"loess"`.

```{r national-health-and--8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r national-health-and--8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
 geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, 
             method = "loess")
```

### 

`method` argument is used to specify the smoothing method to use. "loess" regression is a technique that uses local weighted regression to fit a smooth curve, which in this case is non-linear.

### Exercise 9

Set the `se` argument to `FALSE`.

```{r national-health-and--9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r national-health-and--9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
 geom_smooth(formula = `y ~ x`,
             method = "loess",
             se = ...)
```

### 

By passing `FALSE` to `se` argument, we hide the confidence interval that appears around the curve when `se` is `TRUE`.


### Exercise 10

Use `facet_wrap()` to facet the graph by `gender`.

```{r national-health-and--10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r national-health-and--10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  facet_wrap( ~ ...) 
```

### 

In some cases, such as the case of graphing by one variable, we can use `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()` interchangeably. However, in general, the use of these two functions is different. `facet_grid()` produces a 2d grid of panels defined by variables, whereas `facet_wrap()` "wraps a 1d ribbon of panels into 2d. To learn more about this issue see [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20457905/whats-the-difference-between-facet-wrap-and-facet-grid-in-ggplot2).

### Exercise 11

Adjust the theme of the graph. For a simplistic and clean theme, add `theme_clean()`.

```{r national-health-and--11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r national-health-and--11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Recall that when you add a theme, you add a layer! Use the + operator.
```

```{r national-health-and--11-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... +
  theme_clean()
```

### 

Alternatively, we also can use similar themes such as `theme_light()` and `theme_classic()`.

### Exercise 12

Use `labs()` to give the graph a title and a subtitle, using `title` and `subtitle` arguments. 

```{r national-health-and--12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

### 

Specifying labels for the features of the graph is a good way to clarify what the graph is conveying. 

### Exercise 13

 Continue the`labs()` from previous exercise, and using `x` and `y` arguments, specify axis labels.

```{r national-health-and--13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

### Exercise 14

 Continue the`labs()` from previous exercise. Add `caption` argument, and set it equal to "Source: NHANES (National Health and Examination Survey)". 

```{r national-health-and--14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

### 

Caption can be used for many reasons. One of the main reasons is mentioning the source of the dataset that was used to create the graph. 

### Exercise 15

 Continue the`labs()` from previous exercise. Add `color` argument, and set it equal to "BMI". 

```{r national-health-and--15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r nhanes10-answer}
nhanes_p
```

### 

The color argument sets the label for the thing that was passed to `color` argument in the `ggplot()` object. In this case, because we had passed `bmi` to `color` argument in `ggplot()`, we set the label of the color bar to "BMI". 






## Seguro Popular
### 

The `sps` data set contains information about a study done on a popular Mexican health insurance program, Seguro Popular. In the study, some Mexican health clusters were randomly "treated." The treatment consisted of encouragement for people in that health cluster to enroll in the health insurance program, as well as funds to improve health facilities in that cluster.

### 

Let's create the following plot.

```{r sps_plot}
 sps_p <- sps |>
  filter(education %in% c("college", "high school", "secondary", "preschool")) |>
  select(-c(health_exp_1m, t2_health_exp_1m)) |>
  
  # health_exp_3m is the health-related spendings in the last 3 month. t2 prefix
  # states the data collected from July 2006 to August 2006, and variables
  # without t2 are the data collected from August 2005 to September 2005.
  # Because mexico saw inflation at 2005-2006, the  difference between
  # t2_health_exp_3m and health_exp_3m measures how did the spending habits of
  # participants change. Small difference indicate that health-related spendings
  # decreased.
  
  mutate(change_in_expenses = t2_health_exp_3m - health_exp_3m) |>
  
  # To take into account that each education level would be influenced
  # differently by the experiment, we group by treatment groups and education
  # levels.
  
  summarize(mean_change_in_expenses = mean(change_in_expenses),
            .by = c(treatment, education)) |>
  
  # treatment and control groups were given the numbers 1 and 0, respectively.
  # More convenient to have them with actual group names.
  
  mutate(treatment = ifelse(treatment == "1", "Treatment Group", "Control Group")) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = education, 
                       y = mean_change_in_expenses, 
                       fill = treatment)) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "darkturquoise")) +
    geom_col(position = "dodge", alpha = 0.9) + 
    scale_x_discrete(limits = c("preschool", "secondary", "high school", "college")) +
    
    # in Mexico, currency is Peso. Specified that with the below code.
    
    scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(suffix = "₱", prefix = "")) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(x = "Education",
         y = "Average Change in Health Expenses",
         title = "Spending Changes and Seguro Popular",
         subtitle = "Treatment at college level reduced expenses the most",
         fill = "Treatment",
         caption = "Source: King et al. (2009)")

sps_p
```

### Exercise 1

`glimpse()` the dataset `sps`.

```{r seguro-popular-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r seguro-popular-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(...)
```

### 

The survey was conducted in two different periods of times. Initial period was for applying treatment to treatment group. The second period was for observing treatment results.



### Exercise 2

Start a new pipe with `sps`. Use `filter()` to extract only the rows with an `education` level of `preschool`, `secondary`, `high school`, and `college`. 
Use the `%in%` to accelerate the process. 

```{r seguro-popular-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r seguro-popular-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
sps |>
  filter(education %in% ...)
```

```{r seguro-popular-2-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
sps |>
  filter(education %in% c("...","...",
  "...", "..."))
```

### Exercise 3

Use `select()` to exclude the columns `health_exp_1m` and `t2_health_exp_1m`. 

```{r seguro-popular-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r seguro-popular-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Remember that select(-...) returns all columns except for the 
specified column(s) that come after "-". When you use a vector, 
you only need one -.
```

```{r seguro-popular-3-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  select(-c(..., ...))
```

### 

For columns following a certain name and a sequence of numbers, we can use `num_range()` helper. For more information about `num_range()`, see [this link](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/starts_with.html)

### Exercise 4

Because we want to visualize the impact of treatments, we need a measure of the change in expenses after the treatment is applied. Use `mutate()` to create a new variable, `change_in_expenses`. This variable should be equal to `t2_health_exp_3m - health_exp_3m`.


```{r seguro-popular-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r seguro-popular-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  mutate(... = t2_health_exp_3m - health_exp_3m) 
```

### 

From September 2005 to July 2006, Mexico encountered an inflation. `t2_health_exp_3m` contains the 3 months of health-related spendings from July 2006 to August 2006.


### Exercise 5

Use `summarize()` to calculate `mean_change_in_expenses`, the` mean()` of the `change_in_expenses` for each group. Set the `.by` argument to `c(treatment, education)`.

```{r seguro-popular-5, exercise = TRUE}
  
```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r seguro-popular-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  summarize(... = mean(...),
            .by = ...)
```

### 

To ensure the results are accurate, we need findings that support that health-related spending did in fact decrease in treatment group. Therefore, taking into the inflation account, the difference between` t2_health_exp_3m` and `health_exp_3m` should be lower for the treatment group. 



### Exercise 6

The `treatment` variable is in binary form, taking values 1 and 0. 
For clarification purposes, using `mutate`, change the `treatment` variable. Set every 1 equal to `Treatment Group` and every 0 to `Control Group`. 

### 

Use `ifelse()` for this. Within `ifelse()`, set condition where `treatment == "1"` to `Treatment Group` and `Control Group` in other conditions.

```{r seguro-popular-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r seguro-popular-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
 ... |> 
  mutate(treatment = ifelse(treatment == "...", "...", "Control Group")) 
```

### 

Alternatively, we could have used `if_else()` function from **[dplyr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8)** package. The difference between these two functions is that `if_else()` function is somewhat faster than base package function `ifelse()`.


### Exercise 7

Use `|>` to add `ggplot()`.


```{r seguro-popular-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r seguro-popular-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
.. |> 
  ggplot()
```

### 

We see that `ggplot()` gives us a blank sheet. Now, we should specify aesthetics to change this. 


### Exercise 8

Within `aes` within `ggplot` object from previous exercise, map `education` to x-axis. Map `mean_change_in_expenses` to the y-axis, and `treatment` to the `fill`. 

```{r seguro-popular-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r seguro-popular-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
.. |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = education,
             y = mean_change_in_expenses,
             fill = treatment))
```

### 

Because we haven't specified the plot type yet, we don't see concrete results. We need to change that. 

### Exercise 9

Add the layer `geom_col()`.

```{r seguro-popular-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r seguro-popular-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
.. |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = "education",
             y = "mean_change_in_expenses",
             fill = "treatment")) + 
  geom_col()
```

### 

When you set the `fill` argument in the `ggplot` equal to a variable, ggplot by default sets a color set.

### Exercise 10

To make the bar charts color of your choice, you can use `scale_fill_manual` function. This function takes on values as a vector. Within this argument, set `values` equal to a vector of two colors: `cornflowerblue` and `darkturquoise`.

```{r seguro-popular-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r seguro-popular-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  scale_fill_manual(values= c("cornflowerblue", "...")) +
  geom_col()
```

### 

If we had more categories of data, we also could have made use of   **RColorBrewer** package. This package provides a function named `scale_fill_brewer()`. With this function, you can specify a color palette of your choice. 

### Exercise 11

Within `geom_col()`, set the `position` argument equal to `"dodge"`. Moreover, you can also set the transparency of the bars with the argument `alpha`, where the default value of 1.0 is opaque. For our graph in this section, we set the `alpha` equal to 0.9. 

```{r seguro-popular-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r seguro-popular-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_col(position = "dodge", alpha = 0.9)
```

### 

Alternatively, we could have not specified position argument. In that case, we would see stacked bars, rather than side-by-side bars.

### Exercise 12

We also want to order bars in a descending educational level order.
In our case, we want the order `"college"`, `"high school"`, `"secondary school"`, and `"preschool"`.

### 

We can achieve this by setting `limits` argument of `scale_x_discrete()` equal to order of factors you want. We want the education levels in an increasing order. Therefore, pass in a vector of `preschool`, `secondary`, `high school`, and `college` in this order.

```{r seguro-popular-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r seguro-popular-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
   scale_x_discrete(limits = ...)
```

### 

We also could have other scaling methods. For instance, if we used `scale_x_reverse()`, our bars would be in reverse order, and x-axis labels would be in decreasing order.

### Exercise 13

It would also be more representative if the y-axis values were displayed with pesos sign, since the observed change in health-related expenses is in pesos in Mexico. 

### 

We can achieve this with `scale_y_continuous()` function. Within this function, set `labels` equal to `dollar_format()`. Within `dollar_format()`, set `suffix` equal to pesos sign, `₱`, and set `prefix` equal to `""`.

```{r seguro-popular-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r seguro-popular-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
   scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(suffix = "₱", 
                                                     prefix = "")) 
```

### 

`scale_y_continuous` have formatting values to dollar feature. However, it does not have it for other currencies. In those cases, we have to specify the currency sign by using `dollar_format()` argument and pass it to `labels`. You can find and copy currency signs by searching them on Google. 


### Exercise 14

Add `theme_minimal()` to change the style of the graph.

```{r seguro-popular-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

### 

Alternatively, we could have used themes such as `theme_light()` and `theme_dark()`. 



### Exercise 15

To finish your plot, use `labs()` to give the graph a title, subtitle, axis labels, and caption of your choice.

```{r seguro-popular-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r sps15-answer}

```

## Gender inequality 

This dataset shows the median weekly incomes for 535 different occupations. The data encompasses information for all working American citizens as of January 2015. The incomes are broken into male and female statistics, preceded by the total median income when including both genders.

### 

Let's create the following plot.

```{r gender-inequality}

income_p <- income |>
  
  # these columns were character columns, and there were 'Na's as characters
  # rather than `Na` type. Exclude them below.
  
  filter(f_weekly != "Na" & 
         m_weekly != "Na" & 
         all_weekly != "Na") |>
  
  # convert the character columns that contain numeric values to double.
  # "_weekly" suffices are columns that show median weekly income for each job.
  
  mutate(f_weekly = parse_number(f_weekly), 
         m_weekly = parse_number(m_weekly), 
         all_weekly = parse_number(all_weekly)) |>
  mutate(occupation = str_to_lower(occupation)) |>
  drop_na() |>
  
  # to get highest-paying jobs, filtered by all_weekly. 
  
  arrange(desc(all_weekly)) |>
  
  # select top 25 jobs. 
  
  slice(1:25) |>
  select(occupation, m_weekly, f_weekly) |>
  
  # reorder m_weekly by occupation so that values are in decreasing order.
  
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(occupation, m_weekly), 
             x = f_weekly, 
             xend = m_weekly)) +
  geom_dumbbell(size = 1.5, 
                color = "grey", 
                size_x = 3, 
                size_xend = 3, 
                colour_x = "cornflowerblue",
                colour_xend = "darkslategray3") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2250),
                     label = dollar_format(c(1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2250))) +
    theme_bw() + 
    theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) +
    annotate("text", x = 1990, y = 'lawyers', label = "Male", size = 3.8, color = "darkslategray3") + 
    annotate("text", x = 1615, y = "lawyers", label = "Female", size = 3.8, color = "cornflowerblue") + 
    labs(y = NULL,
         x = 'Weekly median earnings', 
         subtitle = 'Men earn higher than women in high-paying jobs',
         title = 'Gender Inequality in 25  high-paying jobs',
         caption = 'Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics')

income_p
  
```

### Exercise 1

`glimpse()` the `income` data set. Pay close attention to the data type of each variable.

```{r gender-inequality-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

We see that many character columns have "Na" values, but they are written as characters instead of `NA` format. 

### 

In cases where missing values are written as characters, we cannot use `drop_na()` since there are no `NA` types. 

### Exercise 2

Start a pipe with `income`. Then filter()` the columns `m_weekly`, `f_weekly`, and `all_weekly` so that they don't include columns where the values are "Na".

```{r gender-inequality-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gender-inequality-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
income |>
   filter(... != "Na" & 
          f_weekly != "..." & 
          all_weekly != "...") 
```

### 

`all_weekly`, `m_weekly`, and `f_weekly` are median weekly including male and female workers, meian weekly income of only male workers, and median weekly income of only female workers in USD, respectively.

### Exercise 3

Because we want to get the highest-paying jobs, we need to arrange the tibble by `all_weekly`. 

### 

However, because this column is in character format, we have to convert it to numeric. 


Using `mutate`, overwrite the `all_weekly`, `m_weekly`, and `f_weekly`  columns using `parse_number()`. 

```{r gender-inequality-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  mutate(f_weekly = parse_number(...), 
         m_weekly = parse_number(...), 
         all_weekly = parse_number(...)) 
```

```{r gender-inequality-3-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  mutate(f_weekly = parse_number(f_weekly), 
         m_weekly = parse_number(m_weekly), 
         all_weekly = parse_number(all_weekly)) 
```

### 

Alternatively, we could have used the built-in R function `as.numeric()`.

### Exercise 4

For interpretability of results, it would be helpful if we converted `occupation`s to lowercase. We can do this by overwriting `occupation` column with `str_to_lower()` function.

```{r gender-inequality-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  mutate(occupation = str_to_lower(...)) |>
```

### 

Alternatively, we coul have used `casefold()` function. This function is especially useful because we can change the conversion method with one argument: `upper`. If upper is `FALSE`, the result will be lowercase.

### Exercise 5

Now, although we have dropped the missing values in character columns, we have to use `drop_na()` to drop `NA`s in double columns that we will use. 

```{r gender-inequality-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  drop_na()
```

### Exercise 6

To get the highest-paying jobs, we have to order the tibble in decreasing order by `all_weekly` column.

```{r gender-inequality-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  arrange(desc(...)) 
```

### 

Alternatively, we could have used `order()` function to sort rows. Although we would not be able to use it in the pipe, a code like the following can be used outside the pipe: 

````
income[order(income$all_weekly)]
````
### Exercise 7

Now that we have ordered the tibble, we have to get 25 most-paying jobs. We can do this with `slice()`. 


```{r gender-inequality-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
  slice(1:25)
```

### 

Instead of `slice()`, we can use the base R function `head()` to get the first 25 rows with a code such as the following: 

````
... |>
 head(n = 25)
````

### Exercise 8

Select `occupation`, `m_weekly`, and `f_weekly` columns. 

```{r gender-inequality-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...  |>
   select(..., m_weekly, ...)
```

### 

Alternatively, we could have used select helpers to select columns. For example, to get the columns about only male, we would use `starts_with()`, as shown like the following: 

````
select(starts_with("m_"))
```` 

### Exercise 9

To create our plot, we will use `geom_dumbbell()` from **ggalt** package.

### 

Create the `ggplot()` object. Within `aes`argument, set`y` equal to`occupation` column, set `x` equal to `f_weekly`, and `xend` to `m_weekly`.

```{r gender-inequality-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(aes(y = occupation, 
             x = f_weekly, 
             xend = ...)) 
```

### 

Right now, because we haven't specified the `geom` object, we don't see any graph. 

### Exercise 10

Add `geom_dumbbell()`.

```{r gender-inequality-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  geom_dumbbell()
```

### 

Alternatively, to visualize the earning difference between male and female, we could have created a new variable that is `m_weekly - f_weekly` and use `geom_col()`to graph it. 

### Exercise 11

Currently, our graph is not easy to read. As the first step on making it easy-to-analyse, order values by `m_weekly`. 

```{r gender-inequality-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(occupation, ...), 
             x = f_weekly, 
             xend = m_weekly)) + 
  geom_dumbbell()
```

### Exercise 12

Now for color and size selection for the graph, manipulate the `geom_dumbbell()` object's arguments. 

### 

Set `size` to 1.5, `size_x` to 3, and `size_xend` to 3. 

```{r gender-inequality-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  geom_dumbbell(size = 1.5, 
                size_x = ..., 
                size_xend = ...)
```

### 

`size` argument is used to specify the size of the line connecting points. And `size_x` and `size_xend` are used to change the size of the points corresponding to `x` and `xend` argument values specified in `ggplot()` object, respectively. 

### Exercise 13

Within the `geom_dumbbell()` object, change color-related arguments: set `color` equal to `'grey'`, `colour_x` to `'cornflowerblue'`, and `colour_xend` to `'darkslategray3'`. 

```{r gender-inequality-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  geom_dumbbell(size = 1.5, 
                color = "grey", 
                size_x = 3, 
                size_xend = 3, 
                colour_x = "...", 
                colour_xend = "...")
```

### 

`color` argument is used to specify the color of the line connecting the points.


### Exercise 14

Because x-axis ticks overlap, it'd be more readable if we selected only specific ticks.

### 

Within `scale_x_continuous()` function, set `breaks` argument equal to a vector of six values: 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, and 2250. 

```{r gender-inequality-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_x_continuous(... = c(1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2250), 
                   label = c(1000,1250,1500,1750,2000,2250))
```

### 

`scale_x_sqrt()` is used to take the square root of x-axis values. 

### Exercise 15

Because the earnings in this dataset is in dollars, we should format x-axis tick labels with dollar sign. Within `scale_x_continuous()` from previous exercise, set `label` argument equal to `dollar_format()` that has used for breaks.   

```{r gender-inequality-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2250), 
                   label = ...c(1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2250))
```

### 

`scales::percent_format()` is used to format values as percentages. For example, 40 becomes 40%.

### Exercise 16

Add `theme_bw()`. 

```{r gender-inequality-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-16-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  theme_bw() 
```

### 

Using package **[ggthemes](https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/)**, we can access many more themes such as `theme_tufte()` and `theme_calc()`. 

### Exercise 17

Because we want to analyse general trends, grid lines do not provide very much information. Therefore, we can eliminate them. 

### 

Within `theme()`, set `panel.grid.major.x` to `element_blank()`, and `panel.grid.minor.x` to `element_blank()`.

```{r gender-inequality-17, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-17-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) 
```

### 

One of the arguments of `theme`, `panel.background`,  is used to change the elements of the background of the plotting area.

`panel.ontop` is a logical argument used within `theme()` to set whether the grid lines will be over the graph. 

### Exercise 18

To show which colors represent which gender, we will `annotate()` texts. within `annotate()` function, specify "text", set `x` equal to `1990`, `y` to `"lawyers"`, and `label` to `"Male"`. 

```{r gender-inequality-18, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-18-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  annotate("text", 
           x = ..., 
           y = "...", 
           ... = "Male") 
```

### 

`x` and `y` arguments are used to specify where the text should be located. `label` is what the text is going to be. 

### Exercise 19

Now, we should change the color and the size of the text for aesthetic reasons. 

### 

Within `annotate()` from previous exercise, set `color` argument equal to `"darkslategray3"` and `size` argument to `3.8`. 

```{r gender-inequality-19, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-19-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  annotate("text", 
           x = 1990, 
           y = 'lawyers', 
           label = "Male",
           color = "...",
           size = ...) 
```

### 

Using annotate, we can also add shapes such as an arrow and a rectangle. To add an arrow, for instance, we would specify "segment", set `arrow` argument to `arrow()`, and would set `yend` and `xend` values in addition to `x` and `y` values.

### Exercise 20

Now, again using `annonate()`, we will add a text for "Female".
Within a new `annotate()` function, specify "text" and set `x` equal to `1615`, `y` equal to `"lawyers"`, `label` "Female", `size` to `3.8`, and `color` to `"cornflowerblue"`. 

```{r gender-inequality-20, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gender-inequality-20-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  annotate("text", 
           x = 1615,
           y = "...",
           label = "Female", 
           size = ...,
           color = "...")
```

### 

In addition to above use of `annotate()`, by specifying "pointrange" and setting `ymax` and `ymin` arguments in addition to `y` and `x`,
we can add a dot and a segment. To learn more about `annotate()`, see [this page](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/233-add-annotations-on-ggplot2-chart.html).

### Exercise 21

To finish your plot, use `labs()` to give the graph a title, subtitle, axis labels, legend labels, and caption of your choice.

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like. 

```{r}
income_p
```

```{r gender-inequality-21, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gender-inequality-21-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  labs(...)
```
