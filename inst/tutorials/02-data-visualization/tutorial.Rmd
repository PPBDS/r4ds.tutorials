## Introduction
### 

This tutorial covers [Chapter 2: Data Visualization](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html) from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. You will learn about the key functions from the [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html)package for data visualization, including geom_point(), 
[`geom_line()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_path.html),
[`geom_bar()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html),
[`geom_boxplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html),
[`geom_histogram()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html) and more.

## Creating first ggplot
### 

Our ultimate goal in this section is to create a plot displaying the relationship between flipper lengths and body masses of these penguins, taking into consideration the species of the penguin.

Below is what the end product will look like:

```{r}
intro_p <-penguins |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  labs( title = "Body mass and flipper length",
        subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
        x = "Flipper length (mm)", 
        y = "Body mass (g)",
        color = "Species", 
        shape = "Species")

intro_p
```

### Exercise 1

Load the **palmerpenguins** package using `library()`.

```{r creating-first-ggplo-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r creating-first-ggplo-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### 

When we explore the data set, we will see all types of data like integer, decimal, or string. When we explore penguins data set we will see many `values`: state of a variable when you measure it.


### Exercise 2

In the Console, run `library(palmerpenguins)`. The Console and the Tutorial are separate environments. Loading a library in one does not load it in another.

Run `?palmerpenguins` in the Console after loading in the package. After doing so, copy and paste the description here.

```{r creating-first-ggplo-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

The data include size measurements, clutch observations, and blood isotope ratios for adult foraging Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins observed on islands in the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station, Antarctica. 

### Exercise 3

Run the `library()` command with `ggthemes` as the argument.

```{r creating-first-ggplo-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r creating-first-ggplo-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(ggthemes)
```

### 

We can infer from the name of the package itself that `ggthemes` is used to make plots created with the **ggplot2** package look nicer.

### Exercise 4

Type `penguins` and hit Run Code.


```{r creating-first-ggplo-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r creating-first-ggplo-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
penguins
```

### 

Tabular data is a set of values, each associated with a variable and an observation. Tabular data is tidy if each value is placed in its own “cell”, each variable in its own column, and each observation in its own row. `penguins` is tabular data.

### Exercise 5

Run `glimpse()` with `penguins` as its argument.

```{r creating-first-ggplo-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r creating-first-ggplo-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(...)
```

### 

When we run `glimpse(penguins)`, we see so many records or I shall say observations`: a set of measurements made under similar conditions.

### Exercise 6

<!-- Teach what a pipe is  -->

The key command for making plots is `ggplot()` from the **ggplot2** package. Run `ggplot(data = penguins)`.

```{r creating-first-ggplo-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r creating-first-ggplo-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins)
```

###

You should see a blank, grey square. R has set up the area in which it can place a plot, but we have yet to give it anything to plot.

### 

In the realm of data analysis, a fundamental concept is the notion of a variable. A variable represents a quantity, quality, or property that can be measured or observed. Variables can take different forms, depending on the nature of the data being studied. They can be numeric or categorical, continuous or discrete, qualitative or quantitative. 

### Exercise 7

Run `sqrt(16)`

```{r creating-first-ggplo-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r creating-first-ggplo-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
sqrt(16)
```

### 

### Exercise 8

Run `16 |> sqrt()`

```{r creating-first-ggplo-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r creating-first-ggplo-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
16 |> sqrt()
```

### 

The difference between the previous code was it that we are using the pipe operator `|>` which takes anything from the left side and plugs it into the function in the right side.

### Exercise 9

Type `penguins` with the pipe operator `|>` and plug it into `ggplot()` like this
`penguins |> ggplot()`

```{r creating-first-ggplo-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r creating-first-ggplo-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
penguins |>
  ggplot()
```

### 

penguins which is the input is being plugged into the function `ggplot()` which gives the same output as `ggplot(data = penguins)`. While Indentation may not affect code, it is a good habit to do because it helps go through the code much faster.


### Exercise 10

Copy the previous code and within `ggplot()`, run `mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm)` and see what you get.

```{r creating-first-ggplo-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r creating-first-ggplo-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(... = aes(x = ...))
```

### 

`mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm)` specifies that the variable `flipper_length_mm` is mapped to the x-axis of a plot. This allows the length of the penguin's flipper to be plotted on the x-axis.

### Exercise 11

Copy the previous code, within the `aes()` set `y` equal to `body_mass_g` and run it.

```{r creating-first-ggplo-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r creating-first-ggplo-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ..., y = ...))
```

###

To display the data points we need to add a geometric object(geom). We can define a `geom`: the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data. These geometric objects are made available in ggplot2 with functions that start with `geom_`. 


### Exercise 12

The function `geom_point()` adds a layer of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot so copy the previous code and add `+ geom_point()`

```{r creating-first-ggplo-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r creating-first-ggplo-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
  +
  geom_point()
```

### 

`geom_point()` is not the only geometric objects, there are more than this single one and we will learn about them in other sections in this tutorial.

### Exercise 13

Edit your code so that, within the call to `ggplot()`, you add `color = species` within `aes()`.

```{r creating-first-ggplo-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r creating-first-ggplo-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(... = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = ..., ... = species))+
  
```

### 

Scatter plot are useful for displaying relationship between x and y but it is also helpful to ask yourself if there are other variable which might contribute to the relationship. For example, does the relationship between x and y differ for different species of penguins.

When you ran it, you see that the data points differ by the color of the species which just makes the scatter plot more insightful. Color isnt just the only aesthetics. There are more, to find out more go check out [aesthetic mappings](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes.html)


### Exercise 14

Add `geom_smooth()` layer using `+`, and set `method` to `lm` within the functions arguement. 

```{r creating-first-ggplo-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r creating-first-ggplo-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  geom_smooth(... = "lm")
```

### 

`geom_smooth()`: used to add a smooth curve to a scatterplot, which can help identify trends and patterns in data by fitting a line or smoothing function. It offers different smoothing methods like linear or polynomial regression and loess smoothing


### Exercise 15

We have added new lines to the plot, but it does not match the plot in beginning, which displayed only one line for the entire data set instead of separate lines for each penguin species. To do so, delete the `color` aesthetic within `ggplot()` and add it to `geom_point` by running `geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species))`. This allows each point to represent certain penguin species on the island. 


```{r creating-first-ggplo-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r creating-first-ggplo-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  geom_point(mapping = ...(color = species))
```

### 

In **ggplot2**, when aesthetic mappings are defined at the global level, they are passed down to all subsequent geom layers in the plot. However, each geom function in ggplot2 can also accept a mapping argument, allowing for local-level aesthetic mappings that are added to those inherited from the global level. 

### Exercise 16

Not all individuals perceive colors differently due to color blindness or other color vision differences. Therefore,  map the `species` to the `shape` aesthetic in addition to `color` within `geom_point()`.
`
```{r creating-first-ggplo-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r creating-first-ggplo-16-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  geom_point(mapping = ...(color = species, ... = species))
```

### 

In addition to the built-in shapes, ggplot also allows for custom shapes to be created and used in plots. This can be useful for creating unique visualizations or for incorporating custom symbols or logos into a plot.


### Exercise 17

Now that we have the data points, lets add the title, substitle, labels and etc. Copy the previous code, add a new layer using `+` and run `labs()`. Within labs, set `title` equal to "Body mass and flipper length" in quotes.

```{r creating-first-ggplo-17, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r creating-first-ggplo-17-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  labs( ... = "Body mass and flipper length")
```

### 

The `labs()` function takes in several arguments to modify the plot labels, including x, y, title, subtitle, caption, and tag. The x and y arguments are used to modify the axis labels, while the title, subtitle, and caption arguments are used to modify the plot title, subtitle, and caption, respectively. The tag argument is used to add a label to the plot that can be used for reference in later code.


### Exercise 18

Copy the previous code, lets add the subtitle by running `subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins"` after the title.

```{r creating-first-ggplo-18, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r creating-first-ggplo-18-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
  +
  labs( ... = "Body mass and flipper length",
        subtitle = "...")
```

### 

The labs() function can also be used with the ggtitle() function to modify the plot title. This can be useful when you want to have more control over the formatting of the plot title, such as changing the font size or color.

### Exercise 19

Lets modify the x and y axises, type a comma and then run `x` and set it to `"Flipper Length (mm)"`  Type another comma and a `y`, then set it equal to "Body mass (g)" in quotes.

```{r creating-first-ggplo-19, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r creating-first-ggplo-19-hint-1, eval = FALSE}

... |>
  +
  labs( ... = "Body mass and flipper length"+
          subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
        x = ..., y = ...)
```

### 

You can use expressions within the labs() function to include mathematical symbols or other special characters in your plot labels. For example, you can use the expression() function to include a Greek letter in a plot title or axis label.

### 

Finally, it's worth noting that the labs() function is just one way to modify plot labels in ggplot. Other functions, such as xlab(), ylab(), and ggtitle(), can be used to modify specific plot labels without affecting others. It's important to choose the appropriate function for your needs depending on the level of customization you require.


### Exercise 20

You might see that it looks the same as the one in the beginning but we forgot one minor thing which is capitalizing the legend, we can do so by typing a comma and setting both `color` and `shape` equal to "Species" in quotes.

```{r creating-first-ggplo-21, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r creating-first-ggplo-21-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  labs( ... = "Body mass and flipper length"+
        subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
        x = ..., 
        y = ...,
        color = "Species", 
        shape = "Species")
```

Reminder: This is what our graph should look like

```{r}
intro_p
```

### 

## Geom point
### 

To practice the new skills we learned from the plot we made in the previous exercises, we will make another plot which displays the relationship between `bill_depth_mm` and `bill_length_mm`.

Below is what the end product will look like

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

exercise_scatterplot_p <- penguins |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                       y = bill_depth_mm, 
                       color = species, 
                       shape = species)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
    labs(title = "Penguins Beak's Length and Depth", 
        subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
        x = "Beak Length (mm)", 
        y = "Beak Depth (mm)",
        color = "Species", 
        shape = "Species")

exercise_scatterplot_p
```

### Exercise 1

Before we create our plot, we need to get our data, so load the `palmerpenguins` library using `library()`.

```{r geom-point-1, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r geom-point-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### 

Did you know that the `library()` function in R was originally called `require()` in early versions of the language? The `require()` function worked similarly to `library()`, but it would only load a package if it was available on the system, without downloading and installing it if it wasn't already installed.

### Exercise 2

Run `penguins` with the pipe operator `|>` and plug it into `ggplot()`.

```{r geom-point-2, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r geom-point-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot()
```

### 

With ggplot2, you begin a plot with the function ggplot(), defining a plot object that you then add layers to it. 

### Exercise 3

Within `ggplot()`, run `mapping = aes()` and in `aes()`set `x` to `bill_length_mm`.

```{r geom-point-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-point-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(... = aes(x = ...))
```

### 

The x and y arguments of `aes()` specify which variables to map to the x and y axes.

### Exercise 4

Within `aes()`, set `y` to `bill_depth_mm` and run it.

```{r geom-point-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-point-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ..., y = ...))
```

### 

"bill depth" refers to the measurement of the maximum vertical depth of a bird's beak or bill, usually taken at a specific point along the bill. This measurement can provide important information about a bird's feeding behavior, ecology, and evolutionary adaptations.


### Exercise 5

To add the data points, add the `geom_point()` layer using `+`.

```{r geom-point-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-point-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  +
  geom_point()
```

### 

The warning message "Removed X rows containing missing values (geom_point())" is a common message in R.  Like R, ggplot2 subscribes to the philosophy that missing values should never silently go missing. This type of warning is probably one of the most common types of warnings you will see when working with real data – missing values are a very common issue and you’ll learn more about them throughout the book


### Exercise 6

In `ggplot()`, within `aes()`, run `color = species`.

```{r geom-point-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-point-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                       y = ..., 
                       ... = species))
```

### 

When aesthetic mappings are defined in ggplot(), at the global level, they’re passed down to each of the subsequent geom layers of the plot. However, each geom function in ggplot2 can also take a mapping argument, which allows for aesthetic mappings at the local level that are added to those inherited from the global level.

### Exercise 7

Add the `geom_smooth()` layer and within it, set `method` to `lm`. 

```{r geom-point-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-point-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}

... |>
  +
  geom_smooth(... = "lm")
```

### 

In the ggplot2 package in R, the "geom_smooth()" function can be used to add a smoothed curve to a scatter plot to help visualize trends in the data. If no arguments are specified when using geom_smooth(), the function will use the default settings to determine the smoothing method and other parameters of the curve.

### Exercise 8

Add the `color` aesthetic within `ggplot()` to `geom_point()` by running `geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species))` to get three different lines for each species.

```{r geom-point-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-point-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|> 
  +
  geom_point(mapping = ...(color = species))
```

### 

When aesthetic mappings are defined in ggplot(), at the global level, they’re passed down to each of the subsequent geom layers of the plot. However, each geom function in "ggplot2" can also take a mapping argument, which allows for aesthetic mappings at the local level that are added to those inherited from the global level.So that's why we species `color = species` for `geom_point()`.

### Exercise 9

In addition to color, we can also map species to the shape aesthetic. Map the `species` variable to the `shape` aesthetic in addition to `color` within `geom_point()` by running `shape = species`.
`
```{r geom-point-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-point-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
penguins |>
  ggplot(
  mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)
) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = ..., shape = ...)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

### 

Note that the legend is automatically updated to reflect the different shapes of the points as well.
There are also other wasy to edit the legend. Some are the following: `scale_*_discrete()` functions: These functions allow you to modify the appearance of the legend for discrete variables (i.e., factors). For example, `scale_color_discrete()` can be used to change the colors of the legend, while `scale_shape_discrete()` can be used to change the shapes of the legend symbols.

### Exercise 10

Now that we have the data points, lets add the title, subtitle, labels and etc. Copy the previous code, add a new layer using `+` and run `labs()`. Within labs, set `title` equal to "Penguins Beak's Length and Depth" , `subtitle` to "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins" , `x` to  "Beak Length (mm)", `y = "Beak Depth (mm)"`, `color` to "Species" and `shape` to "Species".

```{r geom-point-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-point-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  labs(title = "Penguins Beak's Length and Depth", 
       subtitle = ...,
       x = ... , 
       ... = "Beak Depth (mm)",
       color = "Species", 
       ... = "Species")

```

Reminder: This is what your graph should look like

```{r}
exercise_scatterplot_p

```

### 

## Geom Bar
### 

To examine the distribution of a categorical variable, variables that represent categories or groups of items, we can use the bar chart to do so.

Our ultimate goal in this chapter is to recreate the following visualization displaying the relationship between the islands and the species populpation.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)


geom_bar_p <- penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
    geom_bar(position = "fill")+
    labs(title = "Percentage of Penguins in Different Islands",
         subtitle = "The Adelie species is the species on Torgersen",
         x = "Island",
         y = "Percentage",
         caption = "Data: PalmerPenguins",
         fill = "Species")
geom_bar_p
```

### Exercise 1

Lets load the **palmerpenguins** package using `library()`.

```{r geom-bar-1, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r geom-bar-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### 

The palmerpenguins dataset was created by Allison Horst, a marine biologist turned data scientist, who wanted to create a modern and updated version of the classic iris dataset often used in data science and statistics courses.


### Exercise 2

Run `penguins` and pipe it to a `ggplot()` call.

```{r geom-bar-2, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r geom-bar-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
penguins |>
  ggplot()
```

### 

`geom_bar()` is used to represent categorical data: Bar charts are commonly used to represent categorical data. The x-axis represents the categories and the height of the bars represents the frequency or count of the observations in each category.

### Exercise 3

Within `ggplot()`, set `x` to `island` inside of `aes()`

```{r geom-bar-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-bar-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ...(aes(x = island))
```

### 

By default, `geom_bar()` counts the number of observations in each category: If you use `geom_bar()` without specifying any other arguments, it will count the number of observations in each category and create a bar chart showing the frequency of each category.


### Exercise 4

To make the bar graph, add `geom_bar()` using `+` and run it.`

```{r geom-bar-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-bar-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  geom_...()
```

### 

You can use the `stat="identity"` argument to plot the values of a numerical variable directly, rather than counting occurrences. In this case, the y aesthetic should be mapped to the numerical variable. Finally, it's worth noting that geom_col() is a shortcut for `geom_bar(stat="identity")`, which can be useful for creating simple bar charts without having to specify the stat argument.

### Exercise 5

Lets integrate another categorical variable, so set `fill` to `species` within `aes()` in `ggplot()`.

```{r geom-bar-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-bar-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ...(aes(x = ..., fill = species))
```

### 

If you wanted to customize the order of the bars, you can: By default, geom_bar orders the bars in ascending order based on the category. However, you can customize the order of the bars using the reorder function.

### Exercise 6

Let's find the percentages of each penguins species on each island, so run `position = "fill"` within `geom_bar()`.

```{r geom-bar-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-bar-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  geom_...(postion = "fill")
```

### 

`geom_bar()` can be used with faceted data: `geom_bar()` can create faceted bar charts, where the bars are split into multiple panels based on a third variable. To do this, you can use the facet_wrap or facet_grid function. 

### Exercise 7

Now use `labs()` to set an appropriate title, subtitle, axes labels, and caption for the graph.

```{r geom-bar-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-bar-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
penguins |>
  +
  labs(title = "",
       subtitle = "",
       x = "",
       y = "",
       caption = "",
       fill = "")
```

Reminder : This is what our graph should look like.

```{r}
geom_bar_p
```

### 

## Geom Histogram
### 

To visualize the distribution of a continuous variable, we will be using `geom_histogram()` and it is very useful when you want to understand the deviation of data.

### Exercise 1

Lets load the **palmerpenguins** package using `library()`.

```{r geom-histogram-1, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r geom-histogram-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### 

A continuous variable is a variable that can take on any value within a certain range or interval. It can be measured on a continuous scale, such as time, distance, weight, height, temperature, or any other quantity that can be measured on a numerical scale.

### Exercise 2

Run `penguins` and pipe it to a `ggplot()` call.

```{r geom-histogram-2, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r geom-histogram-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
penguins |> 
  ggplot()
```

### 

`geom_histogram()` creates a histogram: geom_histogram is used to create histograms, which are used to visualize the distribution of a single continuous variable. Histograms show the frequency of values within a certain range, which are typically represented by bins along the x-axis.



### Exercise 3

Within ggplot(), set `x` to `body_mass_g` inside of aesthetics

```{r geom-histogram-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-histogram-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|> 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g)

```

### 

You can add a density curve to the histogram: You can add a density curve to the histogram to show the underlying distribution of the data. To do this, you can use the stat_density function.The `..density..` aesthetic is used to scale the histogram bars to be a density instead of a count, and the `alpha` parameter is used to make the bars semi-transparent so that the density curve is visible.


### Exercise 4

Add the `geom_histogram()` layer using `+` to make the plot.

```{r geom-histogram-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-histogram-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  +
  geom_...()
```

### 

You can adjust the position of the bars: By default, `geom_histogram()` positions the bars to touch each other. However, you can adjust the position of the bars using the position parameter.

### Exercise 5

Within `geom_histogram()`, set `binwidth` to 20.

```{r geom-histogram-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-histogram-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  geom_...(binwidth = ...)
```

### 

The `binwidth` parameter controls the width of the bins: The `binwidth` parameter controls the width of the bins used in the histogram. By default, `geom_histogram()` uses a `binwidth` of 30. Compared to the previews histogram, the 20 bin width is too narrow, resulting in too many bars, making it difficult to determine the shape of the distribution. 



### Exercise 6

Now, set `binwidth` to 200 and see the difference.

```{r geom-histogram-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-histogram-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
penguins |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g))+
  geom_...(binwidth = ...)
```

### 

Looking at this histogram, we can see that it is much better because we can actually define the shape and see the distribution.

### Exercise 7

Now use `labs()` to set an appropriate title, subtitle, axes labels, and caption for the graph.

```{r geom-histogram-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-histogram-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  labs(title = "",
       subtitle = "",
       x = "",
       y = "")
```

### 

## Geom Density
### 

An alternate way to visualize the distributions of data on a continuous variable is to use `geom_density()` which is smoothed-out-version of a histogram.

Our ultimate goal in this section is to create a plot displaying the distribution of body masses of these penguins, taking into consideration the species of the penguin.

Below is what the end product will look like:

```{r}
density_p <- penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, 
             color = species, 
             fill = species)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Body Mass by Penguin Species",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Density",
       fill = "Species",
       color = "Species")
density_p

```

### Exercise 1

Lets load the **palmerpenguins** package using `library()`.

```{r geom-density-1, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r geom-density-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### 

`geom_density()` is a function in the ggplot2 package in R used for creating density plots.

### Exercise 2

Run `penguins` and pipe it to a `ggplot()` call.

```{r geom-density-2, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r geom-density-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
penguins |>
  ggplot()
```

### 

A density plot is a smoothed-out version of a histogram and a practical alternative, particularly for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution. 

### Exercise 3

In ggplot, set `x` to `body_mass_g` within `aes()`

```{r geom-density-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-density-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
  ggplot(...(x = body_mass_g))
```

### 

A density plot is a graphical representation of the distribution of a continuous variable. It shows the density of data points along the x-axis, where the height of the curve represents the density of data points at that particular point on the x-axis.

### Exercise 4

Now add the `geom_density()` call.

```{r geom-density-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-density-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  geom_density()
```

### 

The `geom_density()` function takes in a data frame, and then maps the x-axis to a continuous variable in that data frame. It calculates the density of data points for each x-value and creates a smooth curve to represent the density distribution.



### Exercise 5

The previous graph shows the distribution for all the species combined, so now lets show distribution for the three species. Within `aes()`, set `color` to `species`.

```{r geom-density-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-density-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(aes(x = ..., color = ...))
```

### 

The `geom_density()` function can be customized using various arguments, such as adjust to control the smoothness of the curve, and bw to set the bandwidth of the kernel density estimate used to generate the curve.

### Exercise 6

Run `fill = species` within `aes()` in `ggplot()`.

```{r geom-density-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-density-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(aes(x = ..., color = ..., fill = ...))
```

### 

Density plots are useful for visualizing the distribution of a continuous variable, especially when you have a large number of data points. They can be used to identify the location and spread of the data, as well as any outliers or skewness in the distribution.


### Exercise 7

To make the graph transparent, run `alpha = 0.5` within `geom_density()` call.

```{r geom-density-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-density-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = ..., color = ..., fill = ...))+
  geom_density(alpha = ...)
```

### 

Note the terminology we have used here:
We map variables to aesthetics if we want the visual attribute represented by that aesthetic to vary based on the values of that variable.
Otherwise, we set the value of an aesthetic.

### Exercise 8

Finally set an appropriate title, subtitle, axes labels, and caption for the graph.

```{r geom-density-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-density-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Body Mass by Penguin Species",
       ... = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = ...,
       fill = "Species",
       ... = "Species")
```

### 

Reminder: This is what your graph should look like.

```{r}
density_p
```

## Geom Boxplot
### 

To visualize the relationship between a numerical and a categorical variable we can use `geom_boxplot()`. A box plot is a type of visual shorthand for measures of position (percentiles) that describe a distribution.


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/EDA-boxplot.png")
```

Box plots are a type of data visualization that summarize the distribution of a continuous variable using five key statistics: minimum, lower quartile (Q1), median, upper quartile (Q3), and maximum. The box itself in the plot represents the middle 50% of the data, with the median shown as a horizontal line inside the box. The whiskers extend from the box to show the range of the data, and individual data points that fall outside of the whiskers are shown as individual points (outliers).


### Exercise 1

Lets load the **palmerpenguins** package using `library()`.

```{r geom-boxplot-1, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r geom-boxplot-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### 

Box plots, also known as box-and-whisker plots, are a type of data visualization used to display the distribution of a continuous variable. They were first introduced by John W. Tukey in 1977.


### Exercise 2

Run `penguins` and pipe it to a `ggplot()` call.
```{r geom-boxplot-2, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r geom-boxplot-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot()
```

### 

The `geom_boxplot()` function can be customized using various arguments, such as alpha to adjust the transparency of the box, and notch to create a notch in the box to indicate the confidence interval of the median.

### Exercise 3

In `ggplot()` within `aes()`, set `x` to `species`.

```{r geom-boxplot-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-boxplot-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(aes(x = species))
```

### 

A box that indicates the range of the middle half of the data, a distance known as the interquartile range (IQR), stretching from the 25th percentile of the distribution to the 75th percentile. In the middle of the box is a line that displays the median, i.e. 50th percentile, of the distribution. These three lines give you a sense of the spread of the distribution and whether or not the distribution is symmetric about the median or skewed to one side.


### Exercise 4

In `ggplot()`,set `y` to `body_mass_g`.

```{r geom-boxplot-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-boxplot-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(...(x = ..., y = body_mass_g))
```

### 

Box plots are useful for comparing the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories or groups. They can help identify differences in the median, spread, and skewness of the data for each group.


### Exercise 5

Add `geom_boxplot()` layer using `+` to demonstrate the distribution of body mass for different species.

```{r geom-boxplot-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-boxplot-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### 

By default, `geom_boxplot()` does not display the underlying data points that fall outside of the whiskers (i.e., the outliers). However, it can be useful to visualize these points, especially if they are few in number or if they represent important values. One way to do this is to add the `outlier.color` and `outlier.shape` arguments to `geom_boxplot()`, which will display the outlier points in a different color and shape.


### Exercise 6

Finally set an appropriate title, subtitle, axes labels, and caption for the graph.

```{r geom-boxplot-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r geom-boxplot-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  labs(title = "...",
       subtitle = "...",
       x = "Species",
       y = "Body Mass(g)")

```

### 

Reminder: This is what your graph should look like.

```{r}
box_plot_p <- penguins |>
  ggplot( aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = "Body Mass Distribution of Palmer Penguins by Species: A Boxplot Analysis",
       subtitle = "Comparing the Median and Variability of Body Mass for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Species",
       y = "Body Mass(g)")
box_plot_p
```

## Facet Wrap
### 

As we saw in `geom_point()` plot, we can incorporate more variables into a plot by mapping them to additional aesthetics. However adding too many aesthetic mappings to a plot makes it cluttered and difficult to make sense of. Another way, which is particularly useful for categorical variables, is to split your plot into facets, subplots that each display one subset of the data.

Our ultimate goal in this section is to create a subplot displaying the relationship between flipper lengths and body masses of  penguins, taking into consideration the species of the penguin.

Below is what the final plot will look like:

```{r}
facet_p <- penguins|>
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  labs(x = "Flipper Length(mm)",
       y = "Body Mass(g)")+
  facet_wrap(~island)

facet_p
```

### Exercise 1

Lets load the **palmerpenguins** package using `library()`.

```{r facet-wrap-1, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r facet-wrap-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### 

`facet_wrap()` can be especially useful for exploring complex data sets that have multiple variables or groups, and for comparing patterns and trends across different subsets of the data.

### Exercise 2

Run `penguins` and pipe it `ggplot()` with the pipe operator `|>`.

```{r facet-wrap-2, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r facet-wrap-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot()
```

### 

You can use the scales argument to control the scale of the y-axis in each panel of the grid. For example, you can use `scales = free_y` to allow each panel to have its own y-axis scale.

### Exercise 3

Let's specify the `x`, so within `ggplot()`, run `aes(x = flipper_length_mm)`.

```{r facet-wrap-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facet-wrap-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
  ggplot(...(x = ...))
```

### 

`facet_wrap()` can be combined with other ggplot2 functions like geom_point(), geom_line(), geom_bar(), and geom_histogram() to create a wide range of visualizations that explore different aspects of the data.

### Exercise 4

Let's specify the `y`, so within `ggplot()`, run `aes(y = body_mass_g)`.

```{r facet-wrap-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facet-wrap-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
  ggplot(aes(y = ...))
```

### 

when using `facet_wrap()` it's important to consider the purpose of the visualization and the audience that will be viewing it. Choosing the right combination of input variables and customizing the appearance of the panels can help to convey the message more effectively and make the visualization more engaging for the viewer.

### Exercise 5

Add the `geom_point()` using `+`.

```{r facet-wrap-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facet-wrap-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  geom_point()
```

### 

### Exercise 6

Within `geom_point()`, add another aesthetic layer and run `color = species`.

```{r facet-wrap-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facet-wrap-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  geom_point(aes(color= species))
```

### 

If you want to explore more about the different aesthesitics within geom function check out [Aesthetics](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#aesthetics).

### Exercise 7

Within `geom_point()`, run `shape = species` in `aes()`.

```{r facet-wrap-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facet-wrap-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  + 
  geom_point(...(x = ..., y = ...))
```

### 

Fun Fact: Data visualization has a rich history dating back centuries. One of the earliest known examples of data visualization can be traced back to the 17th century when astronomer Galileo Galilei used diagrams to illustrate his observations of the moon. He sketched detailed drawings showcasing the varying phases of the moon, providing a visual representation of his scientific findings.

### Exercise 8

To facet your plot by a single variable, run `facet_wrap()`. The first argument of facet_wrap() is `island`, which you create with `~` followed by a variable name. The variable that you pass to `facet_wrap()` should be categorical.


```{r facet-wrap-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facet-wrap-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
  +
  facet_wrap(...)
```

### 

ncol and nrow: These arguments can be used to control the layout of the facet panels. ncol sets the number of columns in the grid of panels, and nrow sets the number of rows. By default, `facet_wrap()` tries to create a square grid of panels that fits all the subplots.

### Exercise 9

Finally set an appropriate title, subtitle, axes labels, and caption for the graph.

```{r facet-wrap-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r facet-wrap-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|> +
  labs(x = "Flipper Length(mm)",
       y = "Body Mass(g)")
```

### 

labeller: This argument can be used to customize the labels for the facet panels. By default, `facet_wrap()` uses the names of the categorical variables to label each panel. However, it is possible to create custom labels using functions like `label_parsed()` or `label_bquote()`.

Reminder: This is what your graph should look like.

```{r}
facet_p
```

## Saving Plots
### 

Once you’ve made a plot, you might want to get it out of R by saving it as an image that you can use elsewhere. That’s the job of `ggsave()`, which will save the plot most recently created to disk.

### Exercise 1

Before we save a plot we need to make on so start a pipe with `penguins` datset to `ggplot()` function.

```{r saving-plots-1, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r saving-plots-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
penguins |>
  ggplot()
```

### 

`ggsave()` is a function in R's "ggplot2" package that allows you to save your "ggplot2" plots to a file in various formats. It provides a convenient way to export your visualizations for sharing or further analysis.

### Exercise 2

Add `aes()` within `ggplot()` and specify `x` to `flipper_length_mm` and `y` to `body_mass_g`.

```{r saving-plots-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r saving-plots-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(aes(x=..., y=...))
```

### 

In R, the `<-` operator (also known as the leftward assignment operator) is used to assign values to variables. It assigns the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.

### Exercise 3

To finish the plot, add `geom_point` function with `+`.

```{r saving-plots-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r saving-plots-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  +
  geom_point()
```

### 

Assigning a plot to a variable provides flexibility and reusability in your code. It allows you to easily refer to the plot for further modifications or reuse it in different contexts without recreating the entire plot.

### Exercise 4

Here comes the last part, define the whole plot to a variable `plot_geom` using `<-`.

```{r saving-plots-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r saving-plots-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
plot_geom <- ... |>
                  ggplot()+
                  geom_point()
```

### 

When you save plots using `ggsave()`, it will save your plot to your working directory.


### Exercise 5

Here is the part where we save the plot, so type `ggsave()` and within it set `filename` to "penguin_plot.png" and then set plot to `plot_geom`which was our plot that we made previously.

```{r saving-plots-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r saving-plots-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggsave(filename = ..., plot = ...)
```

### 

If you don’t specify the width and height they will be taken from the dimensions of the current plotting device. 

## More practice
### 

Congratulations! You have successfully completed all the material in the chapter. However, when it comes to plotting, practice makes perfect. So, keep improving your skills by engaging in more plotting exercises. The more you practice, the more confident and proficient you will become. The more you immerse yourself in the world of data visualization, the more you will refine your skills and develop an intuitive sense for creating impactful and informative plots.
