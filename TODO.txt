Read the Instructions for Writing R Tutorials from tutorial.helpers package: https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/articles/instructions.html

Read Tutorials for Books vignette from tutorial.helpers package: https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/articles/books.html

Read R4DS Chapter 14. Start work on r4ds.tutorials chapters 14.

## Anish

Finish Data visualization tutorial, including ggsave.

Look at the other material. Is it good? Edit them. Own it! Delete those that are not good.

Do chapter 15 strings tutorial. And chapter 16 regular expressions tutorials.

Tutorials 10, 11, 12.

## Mirriam

Finish check and fixes on data tidying.


## Preceptor

Move over remaining all.primer.tutorials.

Start Iteration tutorial. Move material from chapter 5 overview tutorial to it.

Might be nice if each middle chapter tutorial (like factors, dates and times, et cetera) finished with a beautiful plot which required the use of skills from that chapter to manipulate the data first. An example is babynames in Strings chapter.


Maybe File -> like commands should be in italics, not backticks? That seems to be the way that R4DS does it.

## Shrink Package

The project is too big, almost 20 mb now. There are some 1 mb or bigger images in RStudio and Code tutorial, and perhaps elsewhere. Shrink them. Or maybe these are all gifs and they can't be shrunk? CRAN does not like packages bigger than 5 mb.

* Decrease size of package. From this command:

find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*' -exec du -ah {} + | sort -rh | head -n 10
1.2M    ./inst/tutorials/05-rstudio-and-github/images/gist_push.gif
1.2M    ./inst/tutorials/03-rstudio-and-code/images/new_quarto_doc.gif
1.1M    ./inst/tutorials/09-workflow-getting-help/images/reprex_addin.gif
1.1M    ./inst/tutorials/03-rstudio-and-code/images/rpubs-9.png
1.0M    ./inst/tutorials/32-visualization-case-studies/images/nyt-plot.png
852K    ./inst/tutorials/32-visualization-case-studies/images/coffee_plot.png
808K    ./inst/tutorials/05-rstudio-and-github/images/gist_proj.gif
776K    ./inst/tutorials/05-rstudio-and-github/images/new_project.png
644K    ./inst/tutorials/02-data-visualization/tutorial.html
608K    ./inst/tutorials/03-rstudio-and-code/images/new_project_2.png

* Or maybe we could store these gifs elsewhere and have the tutorial load them from the web, if it is web connected?

* Don't worry about the size of html files since those are not included in the build of the package because of this line in .Rbuildignore:

tutorials/[^/]*/(?!(data|images|.*Rmd))

## Other thoughts

* You can also invalidate stored work by changing the ID or version of your tutorial. If you publish tutorials within R packages then the version is automatically derived from the version of the package.
