## Srihith

Complete first week of Bootcamp assignments. Keep notes of things to fix/discuss. Email html solutions to me.

Go to “Set up for working on the primer” and go through and complete “Computer set up” and “Project set up”

Go to TODO.txt file in r4ds.tutorials and write “Srihith was here” at the top and save to show that our computers are connected and we can edit the same things.

Read the instructions for writing R tutorials.

Start work on r4ds.tutorials chapters 15 and 16.

## Anish

Work on 2  Data visualization tutorials.

Do the web scraping tutorial and submit a PR with fixes/comments/questions.

## Mirriam

Finish check and fixes on data tidying.


## Preceptor

Move over remaining all.primer.tutorials.

Might be nice if each middle chapter tutorial (like factors, dates and times, et cetera) finished with a beautiful plot which required the use of skills from that chapter to manipulate the data first. An example is babynames in Strings chapter.


Maybe File -> like commands should be in italics, not backticks? That seems to be the way that R4DS does it.

## Shrink Package

The project is too big, almost 20 mb now. There are some 1 mb or bigger images in RStudio and Code tutorial, and perhaps elsewhere. Shrink them. Or maybe these are all gifs and they can't be shrunk? CRAN does not like packages bigger than 5 mb.

* Decrease size of package. From this command:

find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*' -exec du -ah {} + | sort -rh | head -n 10
1.2M    ./inst/tutorials/05-rstudio-and-github/images/gist_push.gif
1.2M    ./inst/tutorials/03-rstudio-and-code/images/new_quarto_doc.gif
1.1M    ./inst/tutorials/09-workflow-getting-help/images/reprex_addin.gif
1.1M    ./inst/tutorials/03-rstudio-and-code/images/rpubs-9.png
1.0M    ./inst/tutorials/32-visualization-case-studies/images/nyt-plot.png
852K    ./inst/tutorials/32-visualization-case-studies/images/coffee_plot.png
808K    ./inst/tutorials/05-rstudio-and-github/images/gist_proj.gif
776K    ./inst/tutorials/05-rstudio-and-github/images/new_project.png
644K    ./inst/tutorials/02-data-visualization/tutorial.html
608K    ./inst/tutorials/03-rstudio-and-code/images/new_project_2.png

* Or maybe we could store these gifs elsewhere and have the tutorial load them from the web, if it is web connected?

* Don't worry about the size of html files since those are not included in the build of the package because of this line in .Rbuildignore:

tutorials/[^/]*/(?!(data|images|.*Rmd))

## Other thoughts

* You can also invalidate stored work by changing the ID or version of your tutorial. If you publish tutorials within R packages then the version is automatically derived from the version of the package.
