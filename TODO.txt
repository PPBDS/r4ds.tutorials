Start the process of getting rid of this NOTE about installed size is 23.5Mb.

Ignore html files.

Ignore files in _es directories, except when there is a corresponding file in the non _es directories which you have shrunk. In that case, copy the new file into the _es directory.

Focus on gif and png files in chapters 3/5/9. 

Easy to make a png be much smaller, to about 50k or so.

What about the gifs? Good question! Get ird of gifs that are not used, obviously. Get rid of the non-useful gifs. Or change gif to png. Adjust text as necessary.

Split up current tidycensus tutorials into indvidual chapters. Order them as in the book. We want tidycensus.tutorials to be as much a book companion as r4ds.tutorials is. Expand to cover other chapters.

Change RCM discussion of validity.

Rewrite Chapter 1. Maybe include some material from r4ds-material-to-add.txt. 

Fix Quarto Websites to not have file names with minus signs in them, like car-plot.

Redo Quarto Websites. Hate that we can't start on Github.

Why don't links open if you pull out the tutorial into its own window?

Change all.primer.tutorials back to primer.tutorials.

Each chapter ends with a "Graduation Exercise," allowing the student to create something, generally a plot, from scratch. This material is additional to whatever the chapter covered. It could be left out of the assignment by a professor who did not find the exercises useful. Everything in the Graduation Exercise was covered in this chapter, or in previous ones. The GE get more complex as you go through the book. At the beginning, they are just plots you do in the tutorial. Then, after RStudio and Code, they are plots which you do on your computer. Then, after RStudio and Github, they always start with a repo which you then connect to your computer. 

Each Graduation Exercise should use material specific to that chapter. So, for example, the GE for the Spreadsheet tutorial would start with some spreadsheet data. Also, each GE would increase in complexity and/or decrease in the specificity of the instructions provided. The first few would be very didactic and step-by-step. For the last few, the first question might just be: "Set up a new repo, connect to an R project on your computer, create a quarto document called `analysis.qmd`, render it, run list.files() at the Console, CP/CR." And so on.

Need to make sure the early tutorials cover things like scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma_format()) since we use it in class in weeks 1 and 2.

Looks like we could stop using Rpubs because Quarto Pub allows you to publish a single document:

quarto publish quarto-pub document.qmd

Expand Intro/Summary for Web scraping.

Chapter 16 tutorial. too_short = "debug" seems like a typo/

Get rid of group_by everywhere, except when absolutely necessary.


Good tibbles to use include diamonds, gss_cat (maybe storms), midwest, mpg,   (There are also several time series data sets, including txhousing.)

Think harder about what we need to import. For most packages, we can just use them in Suggests. When students do Start Tutorial a tutorial with such a package, they will be prompted to install it. And that is fine! 

Make use of https://ggplot2-book.org/ in lots of places. It is a great reference!

Might be nice if each middle chapter tutorial (like factors, dates and times, et cetera) finished with a beautiful plot which required the use of skills from that chapter to manipulate the data first. An example is babynames in Strings chapter.

Even better, instead of a line-by-line plot built in the tutorial, we should have students create this plot oustide of the tutorial. It should be an exercise, like RStudio and Github, which starts with a student making a repo, connecting it to an RStudio project, starting a quarto document, loading libraries and data, building a plot, rendering the document so it looks nice and then publishing the plot on the web. Students need more practice with all these steps.

Make more use of RStudio User Guide: https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/

Maybe File -> like commands should be in italics, not backticks? That seems to be the way that R4DS does it.

Review RStudio and Code. Include material from r4ds-material

Review RStudio and Github. Include material from r4ds-material

Review Quarto Websites. Include material from r4ds-material

Review Terminal. Include material from r4ds-material

## Shrink Package

The project is too big, almost 20 mb now. There are some 1 mb or bigger images in RStudio and Code tutorial, and perhaps elsewhere. Shrink them. Or maybe these are all gifs and they can't be shrunk? CRAN does not like packages bigger than 5 mb.

* Decrease size of package. From this command:

  Chapter 15. Replace police with different tibble, maybe gss_cat. Delete philly-clean.csv and associated code. Or maybe, if that section is not in the book chapter, just delete it.
  
  Make all png files about 50 k.
  
  Decide about the gifs. Can they be smaller? Should we just delete them? Maybe put gifs on Github and just have code download them?

* Or maybe we could store these gifs elsewhere and have the tutorial load them from the web, if it is web connected?

* Don't worry about the size of html files since those are not included in the build of the package because of this line in .Rbuildignore:

tutorials/[^/]*/(?!(data|images|.*Rmd))

## Other thoughts

* You can also invalidate stored work by changing the ID or version of your tutorial. If you publish tutorials within R packages then the version is automatically derived from the version of the package.
