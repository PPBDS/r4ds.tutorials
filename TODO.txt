## Current tutorial status

All tutorials in Whole Game section are done, but would benefit from review, especially Chapter 1, which right now has no connection to the actual chapter.

The Visual section tutorials are not even started, in terms of covering the materials in the book. But they have enough old graphics example to consider them OK for the course.

The missing chapters --- 19, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30 --- are, obviously, missing. It is OK if 22+ aren't ready for the course, but 19 and 20 really should be. Not sure what to do with 29 since most of that material is covered earlier.

None of the chapters in the Transform section are anywhere near complete. The two most important to get done before the class are 15 and 16.

Take a look at Chapter 8 Data Import, the book chapter and the tutorial. Read the chapter first. Do the tutorial. Send me the answers.

Re-read the articles.

## Mann

Clean up Chapter 10: Layers tutorial. 

Start work on Databases tutorial.

## Srihith

Then work on a separate PR for all your changes to the four tutorials you have done.

Read R4DS Chapter 14. Start work on r4ds.tutorials chapters 14.

Start chapter 12.

## Anish

Think harder about how to test the tutorials. For example, if you forget to include library(primer.data) in the set up code chunk, then students won't have access to, for example, the `trains` data set. But, you might still have a question which tells them to type `trains` in the code exercise. That will fail for them! But none of our current testing catches that. We really out to invisibly print every data set from we use in any tutorial to ensure that they are available.

Think harder about what we need to import. For most packages, we can just use them in Suggests. When students do Start Tutorial a tutorial with such a package, they will be prompted to install it. And that is fine! However, that does not work with primer.data. (And with other Github packages?) So, students will be very confused.

Make use of https://ggplot2-book.org/ in lots of places. It is a great reference!

But! If we include primer.data in Imports, as we do now, then it gets installed at the start, along with r4ds.tutorials. Problem solved, subject to the next paragraph.

Get rid of NOTES concerning the primer.data and tutorial.helpers package. I *think* that the best approach is to import from them in the R/r4ds.tutorials-package.R documentation. Import the tutorial.helpers functions which are used for downloading. Also import the specific primer.data sets which are used in tutorials.

Move over remaining all.primer.tutorials.

Start Iteration tutorial. Move material from chapter 5 overview tutorial to it.

Might be nice if each middle chapter tutorial (like factors, dates and times, et cetera) finished with a beautiful plot which required the use of skills from that chapter to manipulate the data first. An example is babynames in Strings chapter.


Maybe File -> like commands should be in italics, not backticks? That seems to be the way that R4DS does it.

Review RStudio and Code. Include material from r4ds-material

Review RStudio and Github. Include material from r4ds-material

Review Quarto Websites. Include material from r4ds-material

Review Terminal. Include material from r4ds-material

## Shrink Package

The project is too big, almost 20 mb now. There are some 1 mb or bigger images in RStudio and Code tutorial, and perhaps elsewhere. Shrink them. Or maybe these are all gifs and they can't be shrunk? CRAN does not like packages bigger than 5 mb.

* Decrease size of package. From this command:

find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*' -exec du -ah {} + | sort -rh | head -n 10
1.2M    ./inst/tutorials/05-rstudio-and-github/images/gist_push.gif
1.2M    ./inst/tutorials/03-rstudio-and-code/images/new_quarto_doc.gif
1.1M    ./inst/tutorials/09-workflow-getting-help/images/reprex_addin.gif
1.1M    ./inst/tutorials/03-rstudio-and-code/images/rpubs-9.png
1.0M    ./inst/tutorials/32-visualization-case-studies/images/nyt-plot.png
852K    ./inst/tutorials/32-visualization-case-studies/images/coffee_plot.png
808K    ./inst/tutorials/05-rstudio-and-github/images/gist_proj.gif
776K    ./inst/tutorials/05-rstudio-and-github/images/new_project.png
644K    ./inst/tutorials/02-data-visualization/tutorial.html
608K    ./inst/tutorials/03-rstudio-and-code/images/new_project_2.png

* Or maybe we could store these gifs elsewhere and have the tutorial load them from the web, if it is web connected?

* Don't worry about the size of html files since those are not included in the build of the package because of this line in .Rbuildignore:

tutorials/[^/]*/(?!(data|images|.*Rmd))

## Other thoughts

* You can also invalidate stored work by changing the ID or version of your tutorial. If you publish tutorials within R packages then the version is automatically derived from the version of the package.
