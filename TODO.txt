## Priorities

We should consider deprecating/removing all the RStudio stuff when Positron is released.

Point people toward positron.tutorials.

Data Import and Numbers took 90/80 minutes last summer. That is too long. Edit them so that they are closer to 60 minutes.

Communication is the tutorial which would most benefit from a clean up. 

Tighten some longer tutorials so that they are more like 60 minutes. 

Test Data Visualization tutorial. Fix up any problems. 

Test both Quarto Websites tutorials. Note that they have been reworked to use Github pages.

Clean up tutorials 24 and 26. 


## Other topics

Would be cool to test commands which we expect students to enter into the Console. Of course, written questions don't allow for test chunks, but we can just make our own chunks, with include = FALSE. They will run during tutorial creation and fail if the command no longer works. Of course, in most cases, we would need to create, on the fly, the file which those commands access.

Make more use of https://ggplot2-book.org/ and https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/

The styler package and its use seem important and worth discussing. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nAfJ-5nkcU&authuser=0 for other interesting options. Note its addition to the new verion of RStudio.
