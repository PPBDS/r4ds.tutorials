## Priorities

Maybe the tutorial id fields should include the number? 05-data-import instead of just data-import?

Remove all the RStudio stuff when Positron is released.

Data Import and Numbers took 90/80 minutes last summer. That is too long. Edit them so that they are closer to 60 minutes.

Communication is the tutorial which would most benefit from a clean up. 

Tighten some longer tutorials so that they are more like 60 minutes. 

Test Data Visualization tutorial. Fix up any problems. 

Clean up tutorials 24 and 26.
