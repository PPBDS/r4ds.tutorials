### All Visual Editor stuff

In the visual editor you can either use the buttons on the menu bar to insert images, tables, cross-references, etc. or you can use the catch-all ⌘ / shortcut to insert just about anything. If you are at the beginning of a line (as shown in Figure 29.5), you can also enter just / to invoke the shortcut.

Inserting images and customizing how they are displayed is also facilitated with the visual editor. You can either paste an image from your clipboard directly into the visual editor (and RStudio will place a copy of that image in the project directory and link to it) or you can use the visual editor’s Insert > Figure / Image menu to browse to the image you want to insert or paste it’s URL. In addition, using the same menu you can resize the image as well as add a caption, alternative text, and a link.

The visual editor has many more features that we haven’t enumerated here that you might find useful as you gain experience authoring with it.

Most importantly, while the visual editor displays your content with formatting, under the hood, it saves your content in plain Markdown and you can switch back and forth between the visual and source editors to view and edit your content using either tool.





The guide below shows how to use Pandoc’s Markdown for authoring Quarto documents in the source editor. (Maybe insert lots of these in Quarto 1 or 2, and then we can drop knowledge like crazy.)



We’d recommend you learn the keyboard shortcut. It will save you a lot of time in the long run!

chunks get a new keyboard shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter, which runs all the code in the chunk.


## Chunk Stuff for Project 2

Chunk label (This has three advantages:)

Your chunk labels should be short but evocative and should not contain spaces. We recommend using dashes (-) to separate words (instead of underscores, _) and avoiding other special characters in chunk labels.

You are generally free to label your chunk however you like, but there is one chunk name that imbues special behavior: setup. When you’re in a notebook mode, the chunk named setup will be run automatically once, before any other code is run.

Additionally, chunk labels cannot be duplicated. Each chunk label must be unique.

The most important set of options controls if your code block is executed and what results are inserted in the finished report:

eval: false prevents code from being evaluated. (And obviously if the code is not run, no results will be generated). This is useful for displaying example code, or for disabling a large block of code without commenting each line.

include: false runs the code, but doesn’t show the code or results in the final document. Use this for setup code that you don’t want cluttering your report.

echo: false prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. Use this when writing reports aimed at people who don’t want to see the underlying R code.

message: false or warning: false prevents messages or warnings from appearing in the finished file.

results: hide hides printed output; fig-show: hide hides plots.

error: true causes the render to continue even if code returns an error. This is rarely something you’ll want to include in the final version of your report, but can be very useful if you need to debug exactly what is going on inside your .qmd. It’s also useful if you’re teaching R and want to deliberately include an error. The default, error: false causes rendering to fail if there is a single error in the document.

As you work more with knitr, you will discover that some of the default chunk options don’t fit your needs and you want to change them.

You can do this by adding the preferred options in the document YAML, under execute. For example, if you are preparing a report for an audience who does not need to see your code but only your results and narrative, you might set echo: false at the document level. That will hide the code by default, so only showing the chunks you deliberately choose to show (with echo: true).

There is one other way to embed R code into a Quarto document: directly into the text, with: `r `. This can be very useful if you mention properties of your data in the text.

When inserting numbers into text, format() is your friend.

Lots more stuff on figures, caching, tables, et cetera.
